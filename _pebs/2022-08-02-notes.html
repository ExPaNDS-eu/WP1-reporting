<h1>Status of deliverables</h1>
<b>D6.24</b> has been uploaded in Zenodo and the EU portal on 29/07/2022.
<h1> Presentation of user meeting in Brussels</h1>
<p>The meeting is planned to take place 02/ and 03/11/2022 in Brussels. Participants should be users from the different facilities and also EU officers. 300 attendees are planned. The first day starts after lunch with an opening session of Patrick and Andy. After that Roger Ecclestone and  Henry Chapman should have a talk. In the evening a working dinner is planned.
On the second day satellite events are planned about different use cases (e.g. tomography).
<p>Brian thinks that we need more input for the second day, because otherwise the people will leave after the first day and we would need to make clear who we expect to come to make it attractive.
The idea is to have thematic sessions and to discuss how ExPaNDS affects the different communities. The users have to understand how the project ExPaNDS and PaNOSC and especially FAIR data helps their work. 
Alun adds that the national perspective is also important to show (e.g. DAPHNE and Swiss community). But Patrick points out that we have to be careful to not change the target of the meeting.
<p>Uwe asks if Brussels is the right place for the meeting. For the EU officers it makes sense, but there is no advantage for the users to come to Brussels. 
Brian adds that we could think about having a side meeting at the EOSC symposium in Prague .
Isabell still thinks it should be Brussels because Henry Chapman and Roger Ecclestone can also combine other appointments.
