intro: "<p>This extended PEB was planned to get all partners around the table to discuss expectations and issues for the last year of the project. The contribution of each facility to our main objectives, for which we defined explicit targets after our mid-term review, was prepared ahead of the meeting and filled in the following document: <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Bo7uD-LVeFf1oPXPK3V8PsJTCO51ZPLSjs8w_cZMAc/edit#'>2022-01-18 Extended PEB part I - objectives</a>.</p>
<h1>Objective 1: 10 FAIR-related actions</h1>
<p>For most partners, the first FAIR-related action induced by ExPaNDS is the data policy update, closely followed by the implementation of PIDs for data. DMPs are a bit further down the line, which is a good indication of the maturity of data management planning in our communities. To evaluate if by the end of ExPaNDS we will have reached our objective of more FAIR data at PaN RIs, WP2 has a final task on self-FAIR-assessment, see item 7 of the agenda.</p>
<h1>Objective 2: (meta)data catalogues at 65%</h1>
<p>WP3 has been coordinating the progress to expose our data, via the PaN search API as well as via the OAI-PMH. Alun sees some good progress which is already materialising for the OAI-PMH and will in the final year for the rest.</p>
<p>The registration of facility open data catalogues in the EOSC marketplace directly is not an objective for all facilities, it will be encouraged but not necessarily expected, as long as the data is exposed by one of the other ways.</p>
<h1>Objective 3: 6 data analysis pipelines</h1>
<p>The first data analysis pipeline to be made available in EOSC will be CrystFEL, which will also serve as a prototype for containerised workflows. The 1-2 following candidates will be identified, to know which facility will be, in the end, delivering which reference analysis pipeline. The same is true for Jupyter workflows, the 3-4 candidates need to be explicitly defined, although these are already mostly “cloud-ready”. Anton will add this to the agenda of the next WP4 meeting.</p>
<p>One possible issue that we should not underestimate is the “paperwork” for EOSC onboarding. Giuseppe offered to set up a working group on onboarding so that we all know how to do it and make sure we offer “onboardable” services.</p>
<h1>Objective 4: Training material in the catalogue</h1>
<p>To adapt to remote access, we observe that beamline scientists are changing their habits and looking for more sustainable ways of delivering training to their users, recording videos e.g. and in general, producing material to be reused and not tailored for one visit, as it was the case before. This represents a good opportunity for us to offer them the PaN training platforms.</p>
<p>This is not the core objective of WP5 which is to roll out the training plan already defined for all ExPaNDS-related training content. However this represents a chance to make this great tool sustainable after the project ends. All facilities are thus encouraged to mimic Soleil’s process to get the BL scientists on board by advertising the platform to them directly, including when not an official partner in WP5.</p>
<h1>Objective 5: 5 members in the EOSC association</h1>
<p>4 facilities are already members of the EOSC association and 2 more are planning to apply, meaning our objective should be reached before the end of ExPaNDS.</p>
<h1>Strategy for validation of metadata standards and FAIR assessment</h1>
<p>Brian took the opportunity of the extended PEB to present WP2’s strategy for its final year because it will need all facilities participation. In particular, 2 workshops will be planned. A first one on the 1st of March will focus on the update of the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4312825'>data management framework</a>, including more links to metadata schemas. The second will be to present and discuss the self FAIR assessment process, around the end of May / early June.</p>
<p>Brian is asking for a nominated representative at each facility to be the prime contact for WP2 to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>prepare the workshop on data management,</li>
  <li>supervise/coordinate the FAIR self-assessment process at each facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>This representative should be familiar with the data management process at his/her facility and be connected enough to seek the right person internally for specific answers.</p>"

aob: "<p>MAX IV and HZB both have a motivated ExPaNDS team and are satisfied with the project. Elettra’s only concern is that their BL scientists are not yet all convinced about FAIR. </p>
<p>Soleil’s learning curve on cloud infrastructure is steep but Majid was positive about the progress achieved and very thankful for the help of the community experts, especially Michael Schuh at DESY. He asked whether external people could be invited to the WP2 workshop on FAIR assessment because Françoise Genova contacted Soleil to discuss this particular topic at the French level. Brian prefers to keep this specific workshop internal, but is happy to talk to Françoise in parallel to see what else we can offer.</p>
<p>Valentina informed us she will be leaving PSI and ExPaNDS at the end of February. All thanked her for a great collaboration and wished all the best for the future.</p>"
