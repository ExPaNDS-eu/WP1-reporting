intro: "<h2>Amendment to the grant agreement #2</h2>
<p>The second amendment WP6 and WP1 have been working on has been submitted last Friday to the Commission for approval. If accepted, the two dedicated European user meetings focused on ExPaNDS will be replaced by the following deliverables:</p>
<ul>
  <li>D6.21 : <b>Promotional video</b> [M21]<br>ExPaNDS promotional video introducing the grant with senior figures emphasising the importance of the work</li><br>
  <li>D6.22 : <b>Librarian symposium report</b> [M26]<br>Librarian and data managers symposium to stimulate debate and consensus on licences for data, the measure of FAIR principles within facilities etc.</li><br>
  <li>D6.23 : <b>User interviews</b> [M28]<br>Six ‘one-minute’ user interviews packaged for social media and presenting the benefits from all key stakeholders</li><br>
  <li>D6.24 : <b>Senior level engagement</b> [M34]<br>Short video series to encapsulate senior level engagement at PaN facilities in open science</li><br>
  <li>D6.25 : <b>PaN communities use cases</b> [M40]<br>Develop a series of 6 use cases in collaboration with all WPs linked to 6 webinars in key topics based areas of the PaN community</li>
</ul>
<p>The associated milestone (MS26 Dedicated European User Meeting) will be renamed as MS26 Ambassador engagement from all facilities user community.</p>
<h2>Use cases to be presented at the PaN EOSC symposium</h2>
<p>The selection of use cases to be presented for ExPaNDS at the PaN EOSC symposium was finalised and will consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the presentation of a <b>tomography case study</b> from Diamond where the publication and the data analysis workflow are open access but not the data - <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80228-x'>see associated paper</a></li>
  <li><b>DOI, FAIR, an MX COVID-19 use case</b>, from Diamond too</li>
  <li>HZDR’s TELBE data analysis workflow and the <b>PaN training platform UX</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Isabelle and Ana confirmed all speakers had been formally invited and had confirmed their contribution. Slides are being prepared.</p>
<p>HZDR is now (very close to) being harvested by B2FIND. It was suggested that if the data search on B2FIND could be added in the workflow presented by the HZDR scientist, it would make a good link to WP3 work too.</p>"

status-quo:
#WP1
- "<p>The next <b>CB meeting</b> (collaboration board, with all ExPaNDS members representatives) is planned for the 17th of November at 2pm CET. Patrick invited the PEB to suggest topics to be raised at the CB level if needed.</p>
<p>In addition to finalising the amendment, Sophie and Patrick met with WP2 leads and co-lead to prepare the update of the <b><a href='https://expands-eu.github.io/WP1-reporting/reports-wp/reports-wp2.html'>progress report for WP2</a></b>. Next in line will be WP3 that Sophie will start planning this week.</p>"
#WP2
- "<p>Abigail reported that following the progress report discussions, it had been decided not to publish the <b>full write-up of the consultation process for the data policy framework</b>, as each individual facility hadn’t sent their explicit consent. It will be kept as an internal project document, in SharePoint. The reference to this supplementary document will be amended in the data policy framework deliverable itself asap.</p>
<p>On the DMP task, Heike is getting ready to have a reviewable version of the upcoming deliverable <b>“DMPs for Photon and Neutron RIs”</b> by the end of October. A useful meeting last week made sure the two simultaneous deliverables (the one from ExPaNDS and the one from PaNOSC), both due at the end of November, were well complementary.</p>
<p>To kick-off the update of the recommendations for FAIR Photon and Neutron Data Management, Nicolas is for the moment still trying to find a date to accommodate most contributors.</p>
<p>Vasily and Kat finalised the organisation of the <b>second workshop on PIDs</b> on the 22nd of October. The <a href='https://expands.eu/2021/10/07/persistent-identifiers-for-research-facilities-workshop/'>programme is available here</a> and the <a href='https://diamondlight.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_dCZeU0ftSOOH9jSVr6r5Xg'>registration link here</a>.</p>
<p>Abigail and Brian also started the discussions on the <b>FAIR assessment</b> task and in particular the opportunity to use F-UJI, a tool developed by FAIRsFAIR to assess the FAIRness of datasets. However in ExPaNDS, we mostly want to focus on the FAIRness of the data creation process itself (the experiment) and not so much the end-result (the dataset). On this topic, HMC will be presenting their experience with <b>FAIR assessment of beamlines</b> to both ExPaNDS and PaNOSC interessees on the 15th of November 2021. Invitations will be issued soon to all WPs.</p>"
#WP3
- "<p>Anton L. is now the interim co-lead of WP3, in replacement of Sylvie. By January 2022, a more permanent representative will be appointed by Diamond. Isabelle added that an internal Diamond stakeholders meeting was scheduled in October to discuss resources.</p>
<p>The <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/Delivering-data-services-to-EOSC#status-of-expands-facilities-towards-a-reachable-oai-pmh-endpoint'>status of HZDR towards an <b>OAI-PMH</b></a> reachable endpoint for its metadata catalogue was updated.</p>"
#WP4
- "<p>The <b>testing framework</b> deliverable is in its final stages, it should be delivered before next PEB.</p>
<p>Patrick reported preparation works continuing for the ExPaNDS contribution to the EOSC-Synergy workshop at the <a href='https://indico.egi.eu/event/5464/sessions/4743/#20211019'><b>EGI conference</b> next Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Anton reported he had been busy working on the DESY answer to the <b>LEAPS questionnaire</b>, which raised awareness on the concrete organisational and resources needs to sustain the outcomes of our project.</p>"
#WP5
- "<p>Since the last PEB, the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171766'>demonstrator for e-learning platforms</a> was published. There were also further enhancements to the platform: adding a privacy policy, adding curators, white-listing known email address domains for <b>automatic registration</b> (@cells.es, @desy.de, @esrf.fr, etc.). Antoine and Oliver are also working on analytics (to monitor the number of visitors e.g.) but first need to solve GDPR-related issues.</p>
<p>Uwe and Ana reminded us that the development is now progressing well, so we need to focus on the <b>content</b>.</p>"
#WP6
- "<p>To follow-up on the <b>librarian and data managers symposium</b> last week, WP6 sent around a survey to participants, which results will be used for a short report on the event.</p>
<p>Isabelle reported the <b>promotional video</b> will be launched next week on social media.</p>
<p>The development of a <b>use case for arts and humanities</b> is progressing, with a foreseeable webinar in the first quarter of 2022. The head of conservation at the Mary Rose Trust would be contributing. Contact is maintained with the user ambassadors from all Europe to continue developing further use cases.</p>
<p>A Diamond user is investigating the <b><a href='https://figlinq.com/'>Figlinq</a></b> tool to judge its usefulness for the community and will be presenting his conclusions in an event WP6 will facilitate.</p>
<p>As hinted during the last PEB, Isabelle confirmed we would have a speaking opportunity for ExPaNDS at the <b>SXNS 2022</b> conference dinner in January.</p>
<p>In terms of <b>large international conferences</b>, WP6 secured a slot at a soft X-ray community conference next summer in Oxford. There are also ongoing talks about a joint ExPaNDS - lightsources.org joint event on big data at the SRI 2022 in Hamburg. And third, WP6 is working on extending and presenting the demo made at our mid-term review at the 2022 Lung Development, Injury and Repair conference (GRS).</p>
<p>Isabelle is also aiming at publishing some metrics, gathered thanks to the earlier survey, on Twitter, for the upcoming <b>World Science Day</b> of the United Nations (10/11/2021).</p>"

aob: "<p>Abigail mentioned the <a href='https://codata.org/events/conferences/scidatacon-2021/'>SciDataCon</a> event starting next week.</p>
<p>Uwe reminded all to register as EOSC providers.</p>"
