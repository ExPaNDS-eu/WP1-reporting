intro: "<h2>Preparation of the annual meeting</h2><h3>Use cases</h3><p>Patrick and Andy’s presentation at the annual meeting will highlight our 2 projects through use cases. 3 possible use cases for ExPaNDS were identified:
  <ul>
    <li>the team who measured for the first time a process that lies within the realm of <a href='https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/339'>zeptoseconds using DESY´s PETRA III</a>,</li>
    <li>Anton’s <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06156-7'>article in Nature on megahertz serial crystallography</a> measured at XFEL but processed and stored at DESY,</li>
    <li>Diamond’s <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18710-3'>article in Nature on X-ray crystallography</a> of molecules fragments binding to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 for which the data was made available in Zenodo.</li>
  </ul></p>
<h3>WP presentations</h3>
<p>The timeline and objective of the WP sessions was discussed. With a basis of 20 minutes presentation + 20 minutes discussion, it is useful to think in advance about how to steer the discussion in case it doesn’t naturally occur. </p> <p>Anton confirmed he was chasing his counterpart for the common WP4 presentation. Alun showed the outline that he discussed with Tobias for the WP3 one.</p>
<h2>ExPaNDS user meeting</h2>
<p>It was agreed we would focus on this after the annual meeting.</p>"
