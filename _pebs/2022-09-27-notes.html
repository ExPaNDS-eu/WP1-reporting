<h1>Nesw from PaNOSC</h1>
<p>Andy has held a <a href='https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP9%20Outreach%20and%20communication/Presentations/NOBUGS%202022/NOBUGS_2022_PanOSC_ExPaNDS_PaN_Data_Commons.pdf'>presentation</a> at the NOBUGS conference. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXUohY0y97A'>It was recorded</a>. The feedback was good. People now know what we did and he got a lot of positive comments. He talked about the better carbon footprint for archiving the data than of doing a one week experiment.
<p>The decision about the final meeting of PaNOSC will be tomorrow during the PMC. 
<p>
<p>EOSC-INFRA-01-01:
<p>There was a first meeting with all EOSC clusters. They already have a name and logo for the project. The LEAPS general assembly shows interest in the grant. 
<p>Two facilities should lead the grant. There are four facilities , which are interested: ESS, ILL, ESRF and DESY.
<p>SOLEIL and HZDR are also interested. Ana is going to ask internally, if they also apply. HZDR will only apply for the open calls. 
<p>Patrick and Andy will have a meeting in the afternoon to discuss how to proceed. 
<p>The general assembly is the decision making body.
<p>Abigail asks if the UK partners can also take part. The EU has not made a decision yet.
<p>The optimum would be one photon and one neutron partner.
