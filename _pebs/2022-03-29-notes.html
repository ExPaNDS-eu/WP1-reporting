intro: "<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Patrick describes the status of the deliverables:
<p>D4.4 is uploaded.
<p>D3.4 is in good shape. A second reviewer is needed. Kat is going to review until mid of next week. 
<p>D2.7 is in progress and will be ready end of May. Brian would like to review D2.7. 
<p>D1.6 needs still some work, but the quality is really important here and we should not rush. 
<p>Patrick is going to write an e-mail to the project officer to ask for the sponsoring of the McXTrace training session at SOLEIL and to ask about a 3-month extension of the FAIR assessment task (#36).
<p>Kat reports that there are no news about the all-hands-meeting, but it should take place before november.
<p>Ana had some difficulties to find a slot for the preparation meeting for the training. It is possible to use the slot from WP 4: 8th of April 10 a.m. Ana and Uwe have to meet before.
