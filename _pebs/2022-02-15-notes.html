intro: "<h2>News from PaNOSC</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The 2nd periodic report from PaNOSC was submitted at the end of January 22,</li>
  <li>The fourth instalment of the internal financial report at M36 was prepared and shared,</li>
  <li>WP3 is working on D3.3 on federated catalogues (due end of March), a work closely related to our own D3.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andy also mentioned we need to discuss our <b>combined face-2-face meeting</b> before the end of the two projects. Kat will follow-up on this topic, gathering the organisational committee for a meeting. The foreseen hosting facility is ELI but this is not yet confirmed and the choice is still open.</p>
<h2>Status of open issues</h2>
<p>Sophie asked each WP to check their <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues'><b>open issues</b> from ExPaNDS GitHub</a> before the next PEB, so we can make a status point. A filter on the labels can be used so only issues concerning one WP are displayed.</p>
<p>For the issue #20 that comes from the mid-term review recommendation to have a <b>catalogue of FAIR tools</b>, after several discussions we suggest to solve it using the <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials?resource_type=tool'>PaN training catalogue with “tool” as resource type</a> and include only tools developed by either ExPaNDS or PaNOSC or recommended in one of our deliverables. There are already some examples there: RDMO, PaN software catalogue, PaN ontology.<br>Uwe and Antoine agreed on the principle. Sophie will give WP5 a bit of time in case an argument against it comes up but otherwise will close the issue.</p>
<h2>ExPaNDS’s Zenodo community</h2>
<p>Sophie suggested we better distribute the responsibility for the curation of the metadata records and DOIs for material uploaded to <b>Zenodo</b> in the frame of the project. The curation rights cannot be transferred from one person to the other so it can become a problem for stale uploads for example (see example of <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues/36'>issue #36</a>). </p>
<p>From now on, main authors will be encouraged to curate their own document, following the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/ExPaNDS-community-in-Zenodo:-good-practices'><b>good practices</b> that are described in ExPaNDS wiki</a>. Kat is the curator of the community, she will check these are correct before accepting a new entry in the ExPaNDS community.</p>"

status-quo:
#WP1
- "<p>In the <b>architecture</b>, Sophie mentioned one of the newly introduced “PaN scenarios” is using the PaN training catalogue’s workflow feature to link the reference datasets with their analysis pipelines.</p>
<p>The first meeting for the <b>working group on onboarding</b> was last week.</p>
<p>DESY found a replacement for a project manager during Sophie’s leave, she will be starting in early March (if everything goes to plan!).</p>"
#WP2
- "<p>The deliverable on <b>PIDs</b> was sent around by Vasily for internal review last Friday. The reviewers have until the 25th to send their feedback.</p>
<p>WP2 is preparing the upcoming <b>workshop on metadata issues</b> (taking place on 02.03.2022). It will feed into D2.7, which are the final recommendations for FAIR PaN data management, and vice versa. For now the work on D2.7 is mostly to align the views of the different contributors, which is taking time but Nicolas sees good progress. <br>Paul noted we should be careful with WP4 interfaces in this document, especially on: 
<ul>
  <li>the fact that NeXus is identified as a major conveyor of metadata (is that the case for reference datasets e.g.?) </li>
  <li>and that at the data analysis stage in the experimental life cycle, one needs to include provenance information. </li>
</ul>We should make sure WP4 is aligned with these statements (and applies them).</p>
<p>Another task is running in WP2 on <b>FAIR evaluation</b>. UKRI is preparing guidance notes and questions to be sent around to partners, after the workshop on metadata. The slides Brian showed at the extended PEB on the strategy for FAIR assessment were shared with the group (on eb@expands.eu) and are also available in SharePoint (<a href='https://dlsltd.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/GRA0046-PRV/Shared%20Documents/WP2'>in WP2 folder</a>). WP2 will start organising the subsequent workshop foreseen in May/June with Kat.</p>
<p>The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6090282'>data policy guidance note</a> is now published in Zenodo so it will now be linked in the training platform too.</p>
<p>Brian also mentioned participating in a preparation meeting for a <b>workshop on policies with the other INFRA-EOSC-5 projects</b>. The event is planned for the 3rd of May, and is really focusing on national and regional projects; he found it hard to find the right level for ExPaNDS to contribute.</p>"
#WP3
- "<p><b>PSI’s open data portal</b> is now a <a href='https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/psi-public-data-repository'>registered service in the EOSC marketplace</a>!</p>
<p>WP3 has been working on deliverable 3.3 which should be available tomorrow for internal review. It contains the description of the <b>whole PaN search API stack deployed at MAX IV</b>, examples implementations from <b>ICAT</b> and also the description of the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/pan-ontologies-api'><b>ontology implementation</b></a>, available independently of any catalogue.</p>
<p>Regarding the upcoming <b>portfolio material for training</b>, its content was discussed and it was agreed it should explain what material was already produced and what will come next, in particular the workshops. This should be discussed with Ana too, in line with the overall training plan of WP5.</p>"
#WP4
- "<p>Majid is getting the upcoming deliverable together, the <b>5 pipelines to be made available in EOSC</b> have been chosen and now each facility responsible for one needs to fill in the document.</p>
<p>Anton reported progress on the <b>containerisation</b>, working on the configuration environment to have consistent ways to mount Slurm e.g. and data repositories, so that it is as transparent as possible to the user.</p>
<p>Uwe noted it was difficult to get <b>commitments from the different facilities</b>, with “silent” participants in WP4 meetings being still an issue. We could be more forceful in asking for answers, taking for example the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/ExPaNDS-objectives-dashboard-per-partner#objective-4-to-enrich-the-set-of-data-services-available-in-the-eosc-with-services-from-national-ris'>main objective for WP4</a> as a “contract” to be filled.</p>
<p>Uwe also suggested offering, in addition to training for the use of the 5 pipelines, specific training workshops on <b>VISA</b>.</p>"
#WP5
- "<p>The <b>new design</b> of the <a href='https://pan-training.eu/'>PaN training portal is now live</a>. Several new materials were added and thanks to the <b>automatic harvesting of LEAPS and laser-lab events</b>, there are also many new upcoming events.</p>"
#WP6
- "<p>This week is “<b>Love your data week</b>”, so Kat is being very active on Twitter for ExPaNDS. Please check, share and retweet. </p>
<p>Every previous <b>event recording and presentations</b> are now available, respectively in <a href='https://expands.eu/presentations/'>expands.eu</a> and in <a href='https://zenodo.org/communities/expands/'>Zenodo</a>: notably the librarian symposium, the PID workshop and the FAIRness of a prototypical PaN instrument presentation.</p>
<p>Kat is working on the 2 outstanding deliverables: the material for <b>international conferences</b> (using Sophie’s presentation at SXNS in January 2022) and the more general upcoming update of the <b>ExPaNDS presentation for conferences</b>. As asked in a separate email, all presentations made recently by someone from the PEB is welcome as input. Please send to Kat or upload to SharePoint.</p>
<p>WP6 and WP1 will need to look for alternatives to the <b>AAAS</b> participation, as it is still planned online and presents less interest in this format. Kat suggested the organisers to co-locate the planned ExPaNDS career-webinar but they admitted they would probably not succeed in getting enough audience for us.</p>"
