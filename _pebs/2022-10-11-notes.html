Juliane started collecting all missing topics for the end of the project, including recommendations, tasks, objectives, KPIs.
The <b>presentation website</b> must be filled. Please have a look and send missing presentations to Juliane.
Juliane has contacted Ornela, the leader of the <b>sustainability</b> work package of PaNOSC and Andy to adjust the sustainability of both projects and the open tasks. A one-page document for LEAPS and LENS readiness to adopt our services is needed. Andy wants to talk about it in the LEAPS plenary, where Ana and Majid are attending. Juliane will write an email with some bullet points about this topic.

<b>D2.8</b> is ongoing and Majid reports about writing meetings with Heike, which is a good idea. 
Abigail and Simon continue writing the  text for <b>D2.6</b>. 
<b>Reviewers</b> for both deliverables have to be found. 
Questions and remarks of the mid-term review will be adapted in <b>D2.9</b>. A planning meeting with WP6 is needed.

Paul, Antoine and Carlo discussed the PaN search API via email. 
Only ten people have registered for the WP3 joint meeting between ExPaNDS and PaNOSC at SOLEIL. Majid will keep the registration open. Unfortunately Alejandra, Brian, Darren cannot attend. Also ALBA and ILL cannot attend. 
Juliane asks who will care about the sustainability of the federated search API. Carlos answers that PaNOSC will do, but this topic will also be discussed at the joint event.

Majid asked EGI for <b>D4.5</b> for a way to have an entry point to the platform. Paul suggested the entry point “infrastructures” and use it for all services. Furthermore keywords like “PaN facilities” or “PaN infrastructure” can be used. EGI is willing to work on this entry point. It would be an icon on the EOSC platform.
Furthermore WP4 is preparing a document for all facilities who are interested in <b>VISA</b> and the continuation of the collaboration.
