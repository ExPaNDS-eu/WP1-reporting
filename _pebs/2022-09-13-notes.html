attendees: "Patrick, Juliane, Abigail, Nicolas, Alun, Carlo, Ana, Isabelle, Thibaud"
intro: "
<p>Isabelle introduces Thibaud, who will work at Diamond for WP6. Kat now has a new position at Diamond. Everybody welcomes Thibaud. 
<h1>ExPaNDS - User meeting and final meeting</h1>
<p>All attendees agree that the user meeting and final meeting should be in Hamburg next to the XFEL and DESY user meeting. 
<p>ExPaNDS internal: 23rd January 2023 PM and 24th January 2023 PM
<p>Open User Meeting: 24th January 2023 AM
<p>The DESY user meeting is the largest attended user meeting.
<p>A remote option is needed for the people who cannot attend in person. 
<p>The open user meeting will include showing the key results of the technical WPs (organized by WP5).  
<h1>WP5 PaN training platform awareness</h1>
<p>At the ESUO ExPaNDS has gotten some feedback during the poster session, where the training platform was presented. The attendees have seen the benefits of the platform, but they did not understand that it is for the whole PaN community and not only for ExPaNDS results. The ESUO agreed that the key message is that it is a collaborative project and a joint platform. 
<p>The platform will also be presented at NOBUGS and at the EGI conference. 
<p>Ana will explore if the platform could be presented at the SOLEIL user meeting. Furthermore the platform should be presented at the EOSC symposium in November.
<p>Project outcomes are both uploaded to the platform by SOLEIL, HZDR and the technical WP partners. WP5 encourages partners to directly upload relevant content or send the info/links to WP5 partners. 
<p>Abigail suggests to provide a “how-to-guide” about the requirements of the uploaded content to make it easier. It takes time to upload something when it is not done regularly.  The guidelines on how to upload content easily are available in the training platform.
<p>LEAPS is discussing this topic within the new INFRA-EOSC-01-01. There is a good chance to work further on this platform, it must be secured that the results are being continued.
<p>Isabelle suggests to share it on <a href=https://www.wayforlight.eu>wayforlight</a>. 
<p>All libraries and user offices should be contacted for a survey on how the platform should be to work best with it. Ana suggests a workshop with the libraries. Patricks opinion is to do interviews with only one person per library to get useful answers.
<p>Nicolas suggests having a handbook or an instruction for the scientists before they start their work on how to store the data in the best way (FAIR).

<p>A summary of the WP4-relevent KPIs would be useful so we ask the right questions so as to be able to efficiently answer those questions - I have them somewhere but good to have the ‘official’ list.</i>
