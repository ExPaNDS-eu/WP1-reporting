intro: "<p><i>This 30 minutes PEB was used as a means of sharing the PEB's impressions of the <a href='https://indico.psi.ch/e/ExPaNDSPaNoSC'>2nd PaN EOSC symposium</a> that had just taken place.</i></p>
<h1>Feedback on 2nd PaN EOSC symposium</h1>
<p>Out of a total of 156 registrants, we had <b>118 attendees</b>. PaNOSC’s PO was there and wrote to Andy afterwards that he had found the symposium very good, especially the conversation at the end, a format he encouraged. Otherwise the attendees were mostly from our facilities, with a few additions reached thanks to ESUO.</p>
<p>All agreed the talks were good and it was appreciated to see <b>science cases</b>. The use cases speakers may have felt a bit rushed, with sometimes no time at all for questions, which can be frustrating.</p>
<p>The interesting concept of <b>“non-specialist” users</b> from Frank’s talk was worth noting. These are users not directly from the community who created the data but well-known nonetheless. It may be an interesting middle layer between principal users and completely unknown users we could focus more on and better describe. In this particular case, it was specific to MX and PDB but could still apply to other domains too. </p>
<p>The influence of ExPaNDS / PaNOSC on the use cases presented was not always clear enough, sometimes it could feel as if we only added our branding. In particular, what Frank’s use case described happened quite early on for us, so it didn’t directly benefit from the projects. On the contrary, we benefited from it, for it showcased the need for FAIR data and pointed to current weaknesses at our facilities.</p>
<p>Then we discussed an important point on one of Robert’s statements that “all data are not equal”.</p>
<p>If we agree that the “F” and the “A” must always be there, at least for the PI and for the facility itself, then why apply the “I” and “R” only to a subset of selected data? Robert’s point was that we don’t have nor the money nor the time to make all data FAIR.</p>
<p>But if only the PI - at best - knows his data and would be able to reinterpret / verify / repurpose it later on, then it might not be worth keeping this data in the first place, as the whole thing is very fragile in the long term. This does not comply with what we want to achieve, in particular if we consider that the data is the responsibility of the facility (which is not the case for all our facilities). </p>
<p>What we should aim instead is making the “I” and the “R” as automated as possible, so the data produced at our facilities is <b>FAIR by design</b>, regardless of its supposed value. For the “F” and the “A”, as was already mentioned in a previous PEB, we would then need to make efforts on <b>curation</b> and quality of service in storage (number of copies and quality of the storage itself as a function of the reproducibility of data, like what is done in WLCG), which is where costs can be saved.</p>
<p>Two things to be noted however, a 100% automation is, to date, not realistic and historically in PaN, the cost of storing data has been much lower than the cost of people, so until now, we’ve kept everything without too much second thought. This might change in the future, at least for synchrotrons, with the increase of brilliance, the upgrade of detectors and the increase in raw material costs.</p>
<p>Finally, it was noted that there are very few projects in PaN to <b>better exploit existing data</b>. For now, it’s not the funding model (notably because facilities are not the funders) and there’s more appeal to make new experiments, e.g. because techniques evolve. But in a more constrained context, there would probably be a lot to gain from reusing existing data. And of course FAIR and open data create these opportunities.<br>Anton made a parallel with the oil industry: when the barrel prices are low, there is no new exploration, so old data is analysed with lots of interest. When the prices go up, new explorations become profitable again and old data is forgotten. Maybe a similar constraint can appear for PaN which will encourage us to exploit more what is already available. </p>
<p>There are already examples of data that are published <b>only for re-use</b>: the ESRF’s human organ program and ESA’s Copernicus data. </p>"
