intro: "<h2>Interim report</h2> <p>The financial interim report is showing an important delay in spendings from almost all partners. The different reasons and solutions for this were discussed:</p> <ul> <li>Some partners don’t book all the PMs that people actually spent on the project, which can be due to a lack of experience with EU projects and can be fixed.</li> <li>Concerning recruitment processes:</li> <ul> <li>Good candidates for ExPaNDS need data management knowledge, PaN knowledge and SW development skills, which is scarce. Some leads to solve this were mentioned like focusing on one requirement per application and selecting the most eager to learn. </li> <li>The UK in particular is observing a scarcity of candidates, likely due to Brexit. </li> <li>COVID has impacted administrative teams, some partners reporting that recruitment was frozen for a period or at least put on low-priority for them to be able to focus on regulating home office.</li> <li>COVID has also reduced the number of applicants for some partners. It is now getting better, with even a lot more applicants e.g. for PSI: scientists who want to shift to data and data experts wanting to be more involved in science, both partly due to current events.</li></ul> <li>Concerning the involvement of existing staff:</li> <ul> <li>COVID made it difficult for some partners to properly integrate new recruits and get them to understand the specificities of PaN instruments from home.</li> <li> COVID also impacted the involvement of the staff working in home office while having to care for their children, which after a few months can be really significant. </li> <li>Meeting F2F gives drive and enthusiasm to people, and again after a few months, the lack of it starts to show.</li> <li>Finally and most importantly, for several partners the IT staff in charge of ExPaNDS-like developments is also in charge of switching their facility’s business model to remote access in general, and in particular remote access to users for beamlines. Their dedication to ExPaNDS was reduced to focus more on these additional urgent new services.</li></ul> </ul> <p>On the technical level and on a more positive note, we start to see the benefits of the current paradigm shift, which is accelerating the uptake of remote analysis, cloud computing and open data. Several partners opened datasets to accelerate COVID research which paves the way to what we are working to achieve with ExPaNDS. More engagement from the users with remote analysis is also perceived. To make these opportunities more concrete, all WPs are to focus on actual examples and how to highlight them and use them for ExPaNDS. </p> <p>Overall the PEB is confident we will reach our engagements by the end of the project, with small readjustments of the work to be achieved that we will keep monitoring as the COVID situation keeps evolving. </p><p> For the upcoming Collaboration Board meeting, Daniel will be presenting the progress highlights for WP2, 3 and 4 and Isabelle the ones for WP5 and WP6. A first version of the presentations will be shared with Patrick by Friday. The message to the CB regarding underspending will be that it can be fixed, with a plan and objectives for mid-term review.</p> <h2>Other transverse topics</h2> <p>Daniel exposed his suggestion for a technical coordination workshop with PaNOSC in September, which he has been discussing with Jamie. The main objective is to make every technical contributor to both projects know each other and discuss on common works, in particular the PaN portal deployment. A small section on COVID is also planned to share risks and opportunities (like we did today) and finally an extra feature would be to have a measure of the capacity of each facility in terms of data production, HPC, etc, as PaNOSC does.</p><p>The idea to add an ‘open space format’ to the agenda was suggested. Isabelle and Kat assured Daniel of their support for the organisation of this event. </p> <p>All other also support the workshop and the 22nd of September was chosen for its date. Two expected outcomes were mentioned so far: a list of technical people and a technical topic for the next workshop. Daniel is building the Indico page and plans to send it around asap.</p> <p>Regarding Andrey’s suggestion to use IPFS as a data transfer solution for ExPaNDS, the technology is very interesting and at the same time seems out-of-scope for now, the project focusing first on delivering what is in the DoW. It would be an interesting topic for a possible webinar though, if Andrey agrees to present his findings. Sophie will talk to him.</p>"
