<p><b>D2.7</b> is being review and will be ready in 1-2 weeks.
<p>The <b>FAIR assessment template</b> is advanced and is ready at the end of the month. The initial workshop is on 6th of July with a representative of each facility of the project. The questions of the survey will be presented and open points will be clarified. 
The survey is open until the end of September, where in another workshop the facilities will present an overview of their responses and how/if the excercise was helpful for them in relation to their goals around FAIR data.. 
By returning their completed survey reports to WP2, facilities are agreeing to having their reports open published as part of D2.6. This will be made clear both in the workshop itself and via a statement included on the survey.  To this end, facilities will need to ensure they have the necessary sign off from whoevers needs to do the sign off at their facility.
