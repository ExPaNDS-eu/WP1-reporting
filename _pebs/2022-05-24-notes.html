ExPaNDS is sponsoring the IXS 2022 in Oxford. 

The senior level engagement (D6.24) is ongoing. The idea was to go to the LEAPS directors meeting and interview the directors with the help of a crew from Diamond for a video. 

WP6 with PaNOSC have submitted an abstract for the ESOF in Leiden (13-16 July 2022), which has been accepted and is taking place 16th July in form of an online conference session, which is for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the presence of a moderator. Each panel member will give a 10-minute talk each, which will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. The topic is open data for healthier societies. "
