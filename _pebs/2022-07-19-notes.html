<p>ICRI side event planned for PaNOSC & ExPaNDS
<ul>
  <li>https://www.icri2022.cz/</li>
  <li>Unfortunately the main event is by invitation only, which will likely reduce the number of people coming and enjoying the main event and our side event. That information was only communicated in recent days. We have our doubts that we’ll have a lot of ‘on site’ participation. We’re currently considering whether to hold this as a virtual meeting only.
</li>
  <li>It is unclear whether we can step away from the side-event. Considering whether Patrick and Andy travel to be there for these two hours. We would like to avoid having invited speakers present without an actual audience.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Will take place at SOLEIL, 29 – 30 August, 2022</li>
