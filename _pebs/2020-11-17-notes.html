intro: "<h2>Feedback on the annual meeting</h2>
<p>Overall the PEB was very happy with the annual meeting, it was well organised and reached its goal to provide an overview of both projects common and extra works.</p><p>For the symposium, the talks on FAIR were particularly appreciated, giving a glimpse on how others are doing it. On a more practical note, the sessions were a bit too long, with only one short break in 4 hours. It is good that the symposium was recorded, some mentioned having missed a few parts because of that. A note on the webinar mode, it is a bit frustating not to be able to tell who was attending. <br><i>Off meeting: when registering, the consent to appear in a list of participants with name and institute was included, so we can upload the final list of participants in SharePoint.</i></p> <p>For the annual meeting itself, it was very much appreciated to hear and understand what WPs in both projects are doing, notably regarding sustainability, FAIR, data transfer and simulations (where both projects are the most different). It was also a good opportunity to pass on messages to everyone, especially for WP5. </p> <p>The fact that WPs leaders from both projects presented together was seen as very useful, with a structure that was always the same, making the whole event comprehensible and consistent. </p> <p>It was mentioned that Michael’s demo for the WP4s was very impressive. It was mentioned that we now need to get forward and have more and more tangible results, stressing the importance of WP4. In this regard the ‘low-hanging fruit’ or better said ‘quick-win’ strategy was seen as a good move for the upcoming months (<a href='https://dlsltd.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/GRA0046/Shared%20Documents/Meetings/Collaboration%20Board/2020-11-13/2020-11-13%20Meeting%20notes%20ExPaNDS-CB.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=pkwLjS'>see also CB minutes</a>).</p> <p>In the Zoom ‘meeting mode’ for the two annual meeting days, the chat was a bit disruptive with lots of parallel discussions while people were presenting. At the same time it was good to see people interacting, and not only WP leaders talking among themselves. Overall, informal and smaller-group interaction was of course very much missed. Maybe breakout rooms could be envisaged for future meetings, to give the opportunity to hear other voices and have more side-discussions. </p> <p>Finally the 20 minutes presentation + 20 minutes discussion with 10 min buffer time before the next talk was a very good format, allowing some flexibility and reasonable time for exchange. However it was again perceived to be a bit long, maybe spreading over 3 days instead of 2 could be considered.</p> <h2>Plans for the mid-term review</h2> <p>Our next big milestone is the project’s mid-term review, that should be scheduled by the European Commission between March and April 2021. The plan for this would be to tell a story linking WP2, 3, 4 and 5 with a use case and demos wherever possible. Patrick encouraged the WP leaders and the TC to start thinking about it.</p>"
