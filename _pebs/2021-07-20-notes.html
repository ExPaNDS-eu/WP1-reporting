intro: "<h2>Welcome to Nicolas as new WP2 co-leader from ALBA</h2>
<p>Nicolas is our newest PEB member, as WP2 co-leader, in replacement of Daniel.</p>
<h2>Agree on the targets for the KPIs in the technical report</h2>
<p>To take our reviewers short-term recommendation #1 into account, we reviewed the KPIs from the <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Qwm0dFVRw87ur0eJF0kynwM89VtNFmWCqcWWDaU6sg/edit#heading=h.iduf78o1jz1'>Technical Report - chapter 1.1</a> and agreed on the following indicative target values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>14 000 scientists to be reached by ExPaNDS dissemination by the end of the project. Basis: number of users in the Diamond database (biggest). An additional KPI could later be the number of ambassadors, which will be of course lower but showing in-depth interactions.</li><br>
  <li>10/10 facilities with a plan to implement at least one FAIR-related action as a direct effect of ExPaNDS, be it implementing PIDs for data, updating the data policy, budgeting a data steward, …</li><br>
  <li>Target for the facilities maturity at xx% - to be estimated before the end of the week based on the first replies each partner will provide to Alun and Carlo by then.</li><br>
  <li>From the 11 reference datasets, have 5 analysis pipelines available in EOSC. Uwe explained the target should not be to have all of them but rather concentrate on the few with the most added-value. Alun also suggested adding the number of partners registered as EOSC service providers as a KPI.</li><br>
  <li>Suggestion to have a target on the total number of attendees to ExPaNDS workshops, at 500, instead of trying to have a number per workshop. To be confirmed with Ana.</li><br>
  <li>Target of at least 5 partners in the EOSC Association. We already have Elettra, EGI and DESY. UKRI is also in the process of becoming a full member and Diamond is considering it, so it seems a reasonable target.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review the PaNOSC/ExPaNDS mapping of activities</h2>
<p>To take our reviewers short-term recommendation #5 into account, Sophie mentioned the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/discussions/15'>ongoing discussion in GitHub</a> on the wiki mapping ExPaNDS and PaNOSC activities and asked for the remaining persons to have a look if possible, again before the end of the week.</p>
<h2>Review new training and dissemination plans</h2>
<p>On the training plan, any feedback on the draft table is to be sent to Ana ASAP. Two open questions were discussed and it was decided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not to include any policy workshop in the plan for now,</li>
  <li>to focus on ExPaNDS workshops in the plan (i.e. not include PaNOSC’s train-the-trainer workshop) but amend the wiki to make clearer that the FAIR and EOSC workshops were ExPaNDS workshops.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the updated dissemination plan, Isabelle is working on it with her team.</p>
<h2>Follow-up on longer-term recommendations from reviewers (see issue #27)</h2>
<p>On the longer-term recommendations, the #4 (<a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues/19'>issue #19</a>) was discussed as WP2 thinks it needs clarification. Brian will draft something and share it with Sophie ASAP. The observation is to be uploaded to the EC portal before the end of the week. </p>
<p>Sophie will clarify with Isabelle if something needs to be included regarding the recommendations on dissemination.</p>
<p>Other recommendations didn’t raise any objections.</p>"
