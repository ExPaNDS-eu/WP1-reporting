  name: Data management planning and DMP
  partner: HZB
  start-date: 2020-03-01
  description: "As the science domains, instruments and techniques vary across national RI experiments, each experiment should describe its approach to providing FAIR data via a tailored Data Management Plan (DMP). This would give details on the metadata collected, the approach to data storage and release, and intended approach to data management for derived data. The DMP can then be used to guide the collection and validation of data and metadata and its subsequent publication and use. Much of the additional cost of developing DMPs for experiments can be mitigated by taking a common approach for a facility and its instruments, and by automatically populating metadata information based on the proposal and instrument information. We propose to develop a systematic approach to the development of DMPs within national RIs. This would include considering outcomes of various international working groups as the Commission’s Expert Group on FAIR data, the RDA Active Data Management Plans, IGs and related WGs, as well as the PaNOSC DMP templates for experiments. We would also consider tools for DMP, such as for example using <a href='https://rdmorganiser.github.io/'>Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO)</a>.<br>Thus we make recommendation on a common DMP framework for national RIs, considering knowledge sources and related roles and activities for DMP relevant information, and then develop a common DMP template for use within RIs, aligned to that of PANOSC, which can be tailored to particular instruments and scientific methods. We then develop and trial an approach to active DMPs, integrating the DMP information into data lifecycle and metadata collections, and within the RDMO tool for policy enforcement and reporting."

  name: Mainstreaming of standards for data management
  partner: ALBA
  end-date: 2022-05-31
  description: "To enable FAIR access to data for users and re-users of data, consistent open metadata standards should be used. However, Photon and Neutron RIs use a variety of metadata standards and formats. A survey of the current use and requirement of metadata within RIs will be undertaken and recommendations on best practice on metadata standards for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability will be developed for the benefit of Photon and Neutron service providers and the wider science user community. This will be undertaken by developing a common metadata framework on different aspects of metadata and other practices required for FAIR data, and in close interaction with the development of detailed metadata ontologies and implementations in data catalogue and API services in WP3, and for use in WP4, coordinating closely with PaNOSC. The framework include recommendations to profile RI metadata to publish RIs data into common EOSC data catalogues e.g. OpenAire-Zenodo, EUDat-B2Find, consider the use of common metadata formats and standards, such as schema.org, and promoting cross-search between RIs catalogues published in the EOSC Portal.<br>Further, common metadata will promote data reuse, with increased contextual and provenance metadata, supporting the whole data lifecycle, in preservation, and considering the use of relationships with ontologies for provenance and preservation, such as PROV-O and PREMIS. The metadata framework will take into account the software environment where data were produced and the environment required to reuse the data, also the events on data lifecycle such as data creation, validation or verification. This task will provide an draft framework early in the project, for use in WP3 and WP4, and a revised recommendation late in the project."

  name: Persistent Identifier infrastructure
  partner: UKRI
  start-date: 2020-09-01
  end-date: 2022-02-28
  description: "Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) are used for data publishing within some existing RIs. We will promote PIDs within the community, sharing best practices in their use and citation by user communities, and on mapping from the metadata framework to PID provider metadata. We will work with projects such as OpenAire Advance (OpenAire Graph) and FREYA (PID Graph) to contribute to the cross referencing of PID information into a graph of connections. Further, we will explore how work on PIDs for additional resources (e.g. instruments, software, samples) could be used within the Photon and Neutron communities."

  name: Quality assurance and certification schemes for data repositories
  partner: UKRI
  start-date: 2020-09-01
  end-date: 2022-08-31
  description: "Certification schemes for quality data repositories (e.g. CoreTrustSeal) and assessment schemes for FAIR data are now emerging. This task will assess these schemes and profile their application to the Photon and Neutron community, and will lead an open self-assessment exercise of the national research infrastructures against these schemes. The task will work closely with the successful project within INFRAEOSC-05-c, which includes the objective of developing a certification scheme for evaluating FAIR data sharing and publication. We would evaluate how the collected metadata and associated data management procedures contribute to certification and what can be learned from related standards (e.g. CoreTrustSeal, ISO Standard 16363 Information package, PREMIS) and self-assessment against the appropriate parts of the certification standard to achieve FAIR data principles."

- id: 2.6
  name: Uptake of FAIR data practices
  partner: UKRI
  description: "Advocacy of the use of FAIR data practice will need to be tailored to different stakeholder groups, in order to be most effective. In particular we will target the following groups: <br>• Senior management and steering bodies;<br>• instrument scientists and other facilities staff;<br>• user groups and specific science communities.<br> We will prepare promotional material and presentations, highlighting the benefits of FAIR data, including user case studies and stories, developing domain specific guidance and training on benefits and rewards of FAIR data within national RIs, working closely with WP5 and WP6 within workshops and outreach. We will also work closely with the competency centre in FAIRsFAIR to make recommendations for RIs to incentivise the use of FAIR data in policies, DMPs and citations, and also consider the skills and competency framework specifically for national RIs."

  name: Develop an EU PaN ontology
  partner: Diamond
  start-date: 2020-02-01
  end-date: 2021-08-12
  description: "Develop ontologies for main application domains of Photon and Neutron science to standardise the metadata used in metadata catalogues based on requirements defined in WP2. This will ensure that federated EOSC metadata catalogues are not only based on a common syntax, but also on a common semantics. The ontology itself will be provided as an EOSC service using existing tools to document and make ontologies accessible (e.g NeOn, Knoodle, Protégé, Swoop). Development of the ontology will be closely linked to the existing NeXus file format and its further developments (PSI, ISIS and DLS have leading roles in the specification and implementation of NeXus). Photon and Neutron-related ontologies provided by NeXus will be used and extended. In a similar way existing ontologies (such as those provided by NIST) should be taken into account."
