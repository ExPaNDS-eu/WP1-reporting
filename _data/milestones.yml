  comments: ExPaNDS first all-hands meeting took place online from 9th to 11th of November 2020, jointly organised with PaNOSC. <a href=https://expands.eu/2020/11/24/panosc-and-expands-pan-eosc-symposium-and-annual-meeting-an-overview/>A newspiece</a> was released in our website, providing a summary of the event, links to presentations and recordings. The annual meeting was very informative for the common and different work both our projects are doing. The discussions will feed the mapping document ExPaNDS and PaNOSC WP1s are currently elaborating as well as the vision and roadmap upcoming deliverable (D6.4) WP6 is working on.

  comments: ExPaNDS second PaN EOSC symposium took place online on 26th of October 2021, jointly organised with PaNOSC. A <a href='https://expands.eu/2021/11/23/overview-of-the-2nd-panosc-and-expands-pan-eosc-symposium/'>newspiece</a> was released in our website, providing a summary of the event, links to presentations and recordings.<br>In addition to presenting six use cases showcasing the work carried out in both projects, we had the chance to discuss with the LEAPS and LENS chairs directly about the relevance of what we deliver and the future of our project's outcomes. This confirmed the growing attraction of data management in European photon and neutron facilities strategy and our role in supporting them making FAIR data and open science possible.

  comments: With the primary goal of supporting PaN FAIR data catalogue services, we have developed a self-contained, stand-alone metadata catalogue release that facilities can download to test and try locally. The code is available in <a href='https://github.com/SciCatProject/scicatlive'>this repository</a> and documented <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5205909'>here</a>.

  comments: To increase the visibility of Photon and Neutron data in the researchers and EOSC community, we published the <a href='https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/psi-public-data-repository'>PSI data repository as an EOSC resource</a>. This will enable EOSC users to find the resource and redirect them to the PSI public data repository, where they will be able to browse published data.

  comments: The first online workshop series of ExPaNDS took place on the 1st and 2nd of October 2020. It consisted of 2 sessions of 1h30 each, spread over the 2 days and was aimed particularly at PaN instrument scientists and facility staff. We had 115 participants for the first day called "<a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/fair-for-facilities'>FAIR for facilities</a>" and 87 participants for the second day, "<a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/the-fair-experiment'>The FAIR Experiment</a>". Materials from both workshops are accessible in the PaN training catalogue.

  comments: WP6 is responsible to provide the tools and actions to increase the visibility and favour the exploitation of the project’s outputs and results. Through the creation of our own website and social media activity, we are also in regular contact with the communication teams at Photon and Neutron Research Infrastructures (PaN RIs) across Europe. This email distribution group currently contains over 20 contacts. This results in ExPaNDS featuring on various community websites, to give a few examples<br>• <a href='https://lightsources.org/?s=ExPaNDS'>lightsources.org</a><br>• <a href='https://cordis.europa.eu/event/id/148203-save-the-date-and-register-photon-and-neutron-eosc-symposium-panosc-expands-annual-meeting'>CORDIS</a><br>• <a href='https://www.eoscsecretariat.eu/search/node/expands'>EOSC secretariat</a><br>• <a href='https://www.egi.eu/events/save-the-dates-photon-and-neutron-eosc-symposium-the-panosc-expands-annual-meeting/'>EGI</a><br>• <a href='https://www.elettra.trieste.it/index.php?option=com_acesearch&view=search&query=ExPaNDS&Itemid=705&lang=en'>Elettra</a><br>• <a href='https://www.maxiv.lu.se/?s=ExPaNDS'>MAX IV</a><br>• <a href='https://www.cells.es/en/@@search?SearchableText=ExPaNDS'>ALBA</a><br>• <a href='https://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/en/search/site/ExPaNDS'>Soleil</a><br>Finally during the early part of October ExPaNDS held two workshops on FAIR and these were also disseminated to our own community and several other communities. We were happy to manage for example an exposure in an NFFA-Europe internal notification and also a <a href='https://www.fairsfair.eu/events/expands-fair-workshops-%E2%80%93-1st-2nd-october-2020'>newspiece in the FAIRsFAIR website</a>.

  comments: The standard information sheet on ExPaNDS is composed of the two videos and associated posters behind deliverables <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3780053'>6.17</a> and <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3757786'>6.18</a>. We chose this video & poster format to better disseminate online, at our facilities and on future events. A new tweet for this last release will come soon on @ExPaNDS_EU and on our website expands.eu.
