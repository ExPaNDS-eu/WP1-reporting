timespan: 12

overview: "For the last year, WP4 has established the organisational framework and technical roadmap to make data services facility-independant. The candidate EOSC data analysis services were selected and their associated datasets made publically accessible. <br/>A workshop gathering ~100 technical contributors from ExPaNDS WP4 but also PaNOSC WP4 and CalispoPlus took place in early October 2020 to share experience and challenges on the PaN portal deployment at our facilities."

progress:
- "Discussions within T4.1 contributed towards the D4.1 organisational framework document defining the organisational framework for during and after the project and guidelines for integrating existing analysis services into EOSC through the PaN portal.<br>
This task is now completed."
- "The selection from day one of ExPaNDS data services that are aligned with the users workflow will create a desire by facility users to keep those services maintained after the ExPaNDS project funding period ends. One outcome of the analysis of the users workflows was the observation that only 10% or so of them involved Jupyter notebooks, while the majority relied on community software accessed through remote desktops, and that in many cases analysis workflows made use of HPC resources to fulfil compute and storage requirements.  We therefore concluded that focussing on Jupyter-based analysis services would have limited application.  Instead, ExPaNDS WP4 will focus on implementing existing community data analysis workflows in portable facility-independent containers against HPC back-end infrastructure.<br/>The selection of 11 data analysis services representative of our users needs has proceeded in parallel with the selection of appropriate reference datasets (T4.4). The selected workflows are described in D4.2, along with their technique. This task is now completed."
- "In addition to the regular meetings that continue to take place between ExPaNDS and PaNOSC, a technical workshop was organised by ALBA in October 2020 on the <a href='https://indico.cells.es/event/249/contributions/'>portal deployment at PaN sites</a>. The preparation of demonstration cases for this workshop and then for the review meeting rehearsal in April 2021 proved highly useful, highlighting key issues to be solved and accelerating progress."
- "The selected workflows and associated reference data sets were published in D4.2 (see T4.2). 11 reference data sets were selected, from 7 facilities and covering a range of techniques accross neutron and photon science. The actual data was made accessible through the links provided in the deliverable. This task is now completed."
- "We are currently in the process of defining testing requirements based on the services outline described in T4.3, and are simultaneously determining the technical requirements for efficiently implementing those tests. As a first step a Jupyter Notebook validation CI was developed at MAX IV and is to be presented to the WP at the end of April 2021."
- "We are currently in the process of implementing the infrastructure required for integration of NRI analysis services into the PaN portal as outlined in T4.3."
- "This task is still pending. Rules and best practices for integration of services into EOSC has been outlined in D4.1, while the architecture for accessing NRI analysis services via the PaN portal has been described in relation to T4.3."

- "During the workshop on EOSC organised by WP1, EOSC-Synergy presented its <a href='https://indico.desy.de/event/29297/#14-service-quality-as-a-servic'>Service Quality as a Service pipeline</a> and we are considering implementing our use case in their framework."
- "Our immediate goals are tasks related to the creation of a common container repository, and enabling execution of common containerised workflows across facilities."
