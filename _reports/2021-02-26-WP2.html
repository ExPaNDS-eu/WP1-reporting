next-steps:
- "We will carry on with the consultations with the facility staff in charge of the data policies, using the 30 key elements of a policy. Over the next 6 months the result will be assessed and consolidated into a final framework for FAIR data policy within RIs."
- "WP2 will continue to work with PaNOSC on the development of a DMP template and framework. This will be via joint monthly meetings with PaNOSC to progress on this task. PaNOSC will focus on the DMP template aspects, while ExPaNDS will focus on use cases to demonstrate the implementation of the DMP template and how this adds value for both researchers and the facility."
- "The metadata framework will be revised in response to feedback from facilities staff on the published metadata framework, with the objective to update the deliverable in November 2021. Further, this will take into account the experience of implementing a common metadata framework and ontology within WP2 and on sharing with EOSC discovery tools, such as B2Find and OpenAIRE."
- "Guidance on the use of PIDs within Facilities will be developed for use across the RIs.  More advanced PID features will be explored, with guidance on the emerging use of PIDs for new resource types such as Instruments, and on the use of PIDs in the research lifecycle, such as for data analysis. Methods for linking and bundling PIDs will be explored."
- "This task will be starting at M22. It will start by considering the current best practices in FAIR data assessment, including the RDA FAIR Maturity Model, and the work of FAIRsFAIR (FAIR-Aware, <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4486280'>F-UJI</a>).  A consultation across the project will lead to an approach to evaluating the state of FAIR data implementation within ExPaNDS."
- "The outreach programme will continue with the planned events at RDA and with facilities librarians covering the FAIR data management aspects in their area of expertise.  Further activities, targeting particularly user communities and senior managers will be planned."
