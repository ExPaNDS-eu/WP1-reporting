title: "WP1 progress report"
wp: "1"
start-date: 2020-06-01
end-date: 2021-01-31
timespan: 8

overview: "This period revealed the true challenges of COVID-19’s side effects on the project. Difficulties with resources finally prompted our partners to unanimously request a 6-month extension of the project from the European Commission. The extension was accepted in Nov. ‘20 and the project schedule adjusted. <br>
The online but however successful annual meeting revealed the need to focus on a quick-win strategy to get shorter-term results and foster the day-to-day collaboration of the technical experts from our different facilities."

progress:
- "To monitor technical progress and expenses for the first 9 months of the project, an interim report was conducted in June ‘20. The significant impact of COVID-19 on ExPaNDS resources workload prompted the Consortium to request a 6-month extension of the project from the European Commission. WP1 took care of the rescheduling of the project and of the amendment process itself. The extension and updated timeline of milestones and deliverables was approved by the EC in Nov. ‘20."
- "The first consolidated financial report was presented to the collaboration board in July ‘20 and participated in the decision to request the extension. WP1 is regularly monitoring recruitment updates from the partners since. The first report on cumulative expenditure incurred by the partners was delivered in Dec. ‘20."
- "An update of the risk analysis was carried out in Nov. ‘20 by WP1 with PaNOSC’s project manager. All risks and actions were reviewed and compared, triggering updates on both sides. <br>
The quality assurance defined at the beginning of the project carries on being applied with the internal review process of all deliverables orchestrated by WP1. The KPIs were also refined with the WP leaders in June ‘20 and in Nov. ‘20. Most of them will however become more relevant in the second part of the project."
- "An important milestone for internal communication was the <a href='https://expands.eu/2020/11/24/panosc-and-expands-pan-eosc-symposium-and-annual-meeting-an-overview'>annual ExPaNDS/PaNOSC all-hands meeting</a> from the 9th to the 11th of Nov. ‘20. WP1 was part of the organisational committee along with WP6 and ELI (<a href='https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/issues/53'>link to minutes</a>).
To facilitate internal communication, WP1, with the help of the technical coordinator, investigated chat facilities for the project. ExPaNDS joined <a href='https://panosc.slack.com'>PaNOSC’s Slack instance</a> in Nov. ‘21. "
- "WP1 delivered a presentation on the EOSC onboarding procedure to ExPaNDS technical WPs in July ‘20. To align future services, WP1 also made sure the EOSC interoperability framework was taken into account in the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4146819'>WP3 roadmap to federated data catalogues</a>. <br>
In August ‘20, WP1 organised the project’s answer to the SRIA consultation. To make our contribution more sustainable, we then published a <a href='https://expands.eu/2020/09/21/expands-and-panosc-position-paper-on-eosc/'>subsequent paper</a> with PaNOSC. WP1 also responded to the EOSC KPIs consultation from the Landscape TF. <br>
WP1 participated in several EOSC-related events, including the ESFRI-EOSC meeting in Oct. ‘20 (acting as rapporteur), the EOSC governance symposium and organised a PaN session at the EGI conference 2020."
- "The <a href='https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/581d82a4-2ed6-11eb-b27b-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-175468053'>FAIR lady report</a> issued by the EOSC Working Group on Sustainability was examined together with PaNOSC and discussed during the annual meeting. A common approach for the sustainability of technical WP outputs was also decided."
- "Since the last report, two Collaboration Board meetings were organised, mostly around the amendment process. <br>
WP1 also helped the technical coordinator organise a workshop with the technical coordination board (TCB) on the portal deployment at our facilities in Oct. ‘20. The event gathered almost all technical contributors to ExPaNDS, PaNOSC and Calipsoplus. It enabled an important sharing of knowledge and progress of our different facilities, including live demos of the deployed portal. WP1 also contributed to the associated <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/blob/master/WP4/20201009-Technical-Workshop-Survey.pdf'>survey on infrastructure status and “cloud-readiness”</a>. <br>
Following the risk analysis update, WP1 suggested occasionally extending the traditional PEB to all our partners. A first extended-PEB will take place in early Feb. ‘21. The bi-weekly PEB meetings remain the heart of the project’s daily management."
- "In Jan. ‘21, WP1 reviewed the project DMP with PaNOSC’s project manager. The PEB confirmed it was still up-to-date and WP1 will carry on applying it."

next-steps:
- "The mid-term review of the project is due to be scheduled after the end of the first reporting period. In March-April ‘21, WP1 will consolidate the technical part of the periodic report and prepare the project for the mid-term review."
- "In March-April ‘21, the financial part of the first periodic report will be consolidated by WP1 based on the information provided by all partners."
- "Common standards for quality of software using e.g <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10902/20146'>the PhD thesis of Dr. P. Orviz Fernandez</a> and the <a href='https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/home/software-services/'>SQAaaS services developed by EOSC-Synergy</a> will be explored with the technical WPs in the next months.<br>
WP1 will work with WP6 to add the most prominent KPIs to the expands.eu website and to disseminate more on women in science, participating for example in the <a href='https://neutronsources.org/women-in-science/'>Women in Science initiative</a> of neutronsources.org."
- "WP1 will finalise with WP6 the updated “welcome package” for project newcomers and continue looking for alternatives to face-to-face meetings to foster team-building."
- "Next steps will focus on helping WP4 with the implementation guidelines for the data analysis services to be made available in a federated infrastructure. Before the summer, a training workshop on EOSC for ExPaNDS will also be organised by WP1."
- "Together with PaNOSC, WP1 will follow the technical developments in WP3 and 4 to help make their outputs sustainable. The work on quality of software in task 1.3 will contribute to this.<br>
PSI’s position in LEAPS-IT will be leveraged to push for LEAPS and LENS to be key players in the sustainability of our products."
- "The Liaison Group (ELG) only exists through the 5b task forces so far. With the newly formed EOSC Association and the end of the EOSCsecretariat project in June ‘21, the opportunity to rethink the ELG will be explored."
- "Although early investigations confirm Brexit will not affect the handling of the project’s personal data by Diamond, a legal confirmation will be sought."
