overview: "Since the beginning of the project, WP5 organised two series of online training workshops targeted at the PaN community. The assessment of available training platforms has also progressed well, the project moving towards a combination of the e-learning platform developed by the PaNOSC project with a PaN instance of ELIXIR's training portal TeSS."

progress:
- "Two workshops to promote the FAIR principles to PaN facility staff and users were organised with WP2 and took place in October 2020. The event and associated material (recordings) are registered in <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/events/expands-fair-workshop'>the PaN training platform</a>. The workshop included contributions from FAIRsFAIR and PaNOSC. <br>Two workshops on EOSC were also organised with WP1 and took place in April 2021. The workshop included contributions from B2FIND, OpenAIRE, the <a href='https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/'>EOSC Synergy project</a> as well as PaNOSC. The event and associated material (wiki) are also published <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/events/expands-workshop-on-eosc'>in the platform here</a>."
- "A training task force was established to discuss the training portal infrastructure and coordination with PaNOSC WP8. The <a href='https://pan-learning.org'>e-learning platform</a> was refurbished as a result of the task force. HZDR participated to the train the trainers workshop series organised by PaNOSC in February and March 2021 along with other ExPaNDS facilities representatives. <br>The alignment with EOSC platforms is discussed in the INFRA-EOSC-5 task force on training where WP5 participates. We notably decided to re-use ELIXIR's training portal <a href='https://tess.elixir-europe.org/'>TeSS</a> to complement PaNOSC's e-learning platform with a low-barrier mechanism to reference PaN training material. <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/'>A PaN instance of TeSS</a> was already implemented by HZDR and is now in production."
- "First training material was developed along with the two workshops (see task 5.1). The main training material is being defined with the technical work packages."
- "Preliminary results from the surveys performed after the two ExPaNDS workshops were presented to the project and will be included in the next annual report for WP5."

next-steps:
- "Three additional series of workshops will be organised during the final year of the project. The next topics will be focused on WP3 and WP4 developments and will ensure a maximum take-up of the project's results."
- "A demonstrator for using the e-learning platforms for PaN will be provided in September 2021 (deliverable 5.4). <br><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rpuDwCrt-tC-kY5pNiJ2pOwFL-UQppy2Fra74Jja1JA/edit#gid=157509536'>Standard metadata for training material</a> developed by the <a href='https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/education-and-training-handling-research-data-ig/wiki/ethrd-ig-focus-group-materials'>RDA Interest Group on education for research data</a> will be used for interoperability and possible harvesting of our training catalogue by EOSC training platforms."
- "The training material defined with the WP leaders will now start to be developed for the first technical outputs (WP3 ontology, WP5 testing framework etc.)."
- "Further analysis of the first workshops and adjustment of the future surveys will be made. In parallel, KPIs on the training material in the platform will be more accurately described and further developed in collaboration with PaNOSC WP8."
