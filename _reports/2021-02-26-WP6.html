next-steps:
- "Next steps will be to concentrate on implementing our <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4424770'>Vision and Roadmap activities</a> planned for the remainder of 2021 and beyond, with the creation of use cases relevant to ExPaNDS and in collaboration with other grants. Discussions are ongoing to organise and host a symposium targeted specifically at librarians with WP2 to cover all FAIR data management aspects in their area of expertise. We are also in talks with WP5 to organise the next joint PaNOSC / ExPaNDS learning portal workshop to map training available for facility users.<br>In addition, ExPaNDS is looking to engage with publishers to add data fields for publications, to encourage the change needed that data fields are linked to Publications more ‘naturally’."
