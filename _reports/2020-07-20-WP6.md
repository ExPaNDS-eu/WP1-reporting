timespan: 10

overview: "Since the beginning of the project, WP6 has developed and implemented the communications and outreach strategy for ExPaNDS. The website and the SharePoint collaboration space are two major tools for the project, covering internal and external use.
The work package is facing the challenge of disseminating during COVID-19 times, in particular due to social distancing and travel restrictions directly impacting on upcoming events. WP6 is looking at alternative options of online project promotion and hosting webinars."

progress:
- "WP6 has set up a <a href='https://expands.eu'>website</a> for ExPaNDS and updates it regularly. In March, a link to the internal collaboration tool was added. In April, a page containing the open job applications at our partners was created.<br>
ExPaNDS SharePoint was also put into place in January and is now fully functional (105 members recorded on 07.05.2020).<br>
ExPaNDS’ twitter account is regularly updated with news from the project and from the PaN or EOSC community (total of 67 tweets and a total of 124 followers recorded on 26.06.2020).<br>
ExPaNDS LinkedIn account is updated with news from the project (total of 18 followers recorded on 26.06.2020).<br>
WP6 participates in the <a href='https://www.eoscsecretariat.eu/news-opinion/working-together-eosc-collaboration-agreement'>5b projects task force on communication</a>.<br>
WP6 is also assisting WP1 in the organisation of the joint hands annual meeting which will be held with PaNOSC in November 2020 in Prague, planning includes consideration for event to be held ‘virtually’ if travel restrictions are still imposed.<br>
WP6 represented ExPaNDS at the DESY-XFEL user meeting in Hamburg in January 2020, where postcards were also handed out to the user meeting attendees highlighting the project and driving traffic to the website and the project mailing list."
- "The development of ExPaNDS full brand started early on in the project with logos and banners already available for the kick-off meeting in September 2019. A postcard was designed for the XFEL-DESY user meeting in January 2020. Two posters were also designed to be used at our partner facilities but also during events, for general information on ExPaNDS and the benefits of open data.<br>
A first infographic video was produced and disseminated over social media in early April, including in lightsources.org newsletter. A second infographics video was designed, focusing on the benefits of open data and released over social media in May. Both infographics and video were also sent to all Head of Communications at all participating national facilities for dissemination.<br>
General presentation templates of ExPaNDS are available to all partners in the SharePoint.<br>
ExPaNDS postcard size flyers are also available for events / meetings although dissemination of these is now affected by COVID-19 outbreak."
- "WP6 proposed in October 2019 an initial version of the ExPaNDS taxonomy (excluding neutron) to start the development process of a common vocabulary to classify and categorise all appropriate records and datasets."

next-steps:
- "A ‘related projects’ page will be added to the website, in particular to link ExPaNDS to PaNOSC, LEAPS, LENS and the other 5b projects.<br>The next major activity will be identifying strategic opportunities to engage with the PaN user community to involve them more in the grant.<br>WP6 is in communication with AAAS 2021 and AIRAPR/EHPRG 2021 for sponsorship and potential speaking opportunities. In general, COVID countermeasures will continue to be sought, together with large conference organizers, investigating alternative mechanisms to disseminate ExPaNDS, through short presentations, sponsoring, online posters.<br><i>N.B: A joint application with PaNOSC to ICT 2020 was pursued but the event has since then been cancelled.</i>"
- "Dissemination of the third infographics video in July, liaising with all collaboration partners to offer printed posters to be displayed at all collaboration facilities and continue to increase Twitter and LinkedIn followers."
- "As a second step for this task, WP6 will start working on metrics in order to enable an efficient monitoring of the project’s KPI."
