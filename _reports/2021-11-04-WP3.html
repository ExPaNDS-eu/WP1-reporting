progress:

- "The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4806026'>techniques ontology PaNET and the Nexus ontology</a> were both published in early June 2021. They are available in <a href='https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PANET'>BioPortal</a> and in <a href='https://github.com/nexusformat/NeXusOntology'>NeXus GitHub</a>, respectively.<br>
A data manager is being hired at Diamond to replace Sylvie. His/her tasks will include sustaining the ontologies and defining the governance to maintain them more broadly."
- "In SciCat, PaNET is already implemented: the user is suggested with search terms from the techniques ontology. A <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5205909'>self-contained SciCat instance</a> was made available for facilities to test and try locally.<br>
The task continues with implementation of PaNET in ICAT. The implementation of the ontologies in both community catalogues will be described in the upcoming deliverable D3.3 planned for February 2022."
- "This task was kicked-off in early Autumn 2021 and is currently looking to update the assessment of where the partners stand with their metadata catalogues compared to the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4146819'>status made in the frame of task 3.1</a>. In addition to the current status, the task wants to understand the priorities, the road blockers and where assistance is most needed. "
- "In addition to PSI, HZDR now also has a functional OAI-PMH interface and is harvested by B2FIND. It is envisaged, in addition to the PaN search API made available in EOSC by PaNOSC, to declare each facility's open data portal (or OAI-PMH interface?) as individual services in the EOSC marketplace."
- "The training plan was discussed in the frame of WP5 after the project’s mid-term review and will continue to be carried out in the following months. Training material was already made available in the project’s training platform:<br>
- <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/metadata-catalogue-release'>stand-alone metadata catalogue</a>,<br>
- <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/delivering-data-services-to-eosc'>wiki on OAI-PMH and metadata harvesting</a>,<br>
- <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS-nexus-dcat-mapping-ontology'>mapping DCAT ontology and Nexus</a>,<br>
- <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/expands-nexusontology-machine-readable-ontology-of-the-nexus-definitions'>NexusOntology</a>,<br>
- <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/materials/expands-photon-and-neutron-experimental-techniques-panet-ontology'>PaNET ontology</a>."

next-steps:
- ""
- "PaNET in BioPortal or in the EGI Ontoportal instance still needs to be made available as an EOSC service. <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues/13'>Issue #13</a> is used to track this.<br>The governance and sustainability plan for the ontologies is still to be fine-tuned and formalised. <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues/21'>Issue #21</a> will be used to track this."
- "The release procedure for the updated search API in SciCat and ICAT need to be (finalised and) advertised.<br>Next step will be to implement the metadata for the ontologies in the datasets themselves so that the search API can return rich results, but this has to be done at each individual facility."
- "The <a href='https://forms.gle/eMJPTqNYXGmfYf9t6'>survey</a> will be followed by a workshop (<a href='https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/ShhWIWuDeDRVqnkK'>poll here</a>) to present and discuss the results."
- "Carry on implementing federated AAI for access to SciCat and ICAT (supporting OpenID Connect) and assisting facilities to implement their OAI-PMH interface, register as a provider to B2FIND and deploy an OIDC (e.g. Keycloak) middle-layer for AAI."
- "A first deliverable is due already in March 2021 although the underlying work might not be finished. The need to postpone this deliverable will be assessed and reported back to WP1 if needed."
