timespan: 8

overview: "In 2019, WP2 focused on establishing the baseline, gathering information on data policies at the different partner facilities. <br>
Since Feb. ‘20 activities have ramped-up to focus on the revision of the PaN data policy with PaNOSC. The elaboration of recommendations for data management is now also starting up, e.g. with a common glossary of terms and data life cycle."

progress:
- "ExPaNDS involvment with the PaNOSC revision of the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3738497'>PaN data policy framework of 2011</a> progressed very well over the last 2 months, thanks to up to 2 workshops per week. <br>
The PaNOSC draft policy framework is currently being evaluated against the <a href='https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-data-maturity-model-wg/outcomes/fair-data-maturity-model-specification-and-guidelines'>RDA data maturity model </a> and ExPaNDS partners are contributing to these discussions."
- "T2.2 helped WP1 elaborate the project <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672925'>DMP</a> in Jan ‘20. The activities on DMPs for PaN RIs just started."
- "The baseline for this task was defined thanks to the <a href='http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3673811'>landscaping survey</a> done with all partner facilities in Dec ‘19, including level of FAIRness and GDPR compliancy of existing data policies, and current practices regarding DMPs.
A common glossary of terms for data management at national RIs was started in March. As a first step, terms and definitions from a range of sources within PaN (e.g. existing PaN facility data policies) and outside PaN (e.g. <a href='https://casrai.org/rdm-glossary/'>RDM glossary</a>) were collected by WP2 partners."

- "In Nov. ‘19, WP2 gave a presentation at the OpenScienceFair in Porto and participated in the FAIRsFAIR synchronisation task force in Budapest.<br>
March ‘20 saw an initial discussion between WP5 and WP2 around the first training workshop on FAIR data practices to be held in Autumn ‘20.<br>
There has also been some initial discussion with the FAIRsFAIR project to determine what training resources and other outputs from that project could prove useful for the ExPaNDS workshop. <br>
Since it started in Jan. ‘20, WP2 also participates in the FAIR task force with other 5b projects (~1 meeting / month to share progress and common goals). <br>
In April 2020, separate meetings with the EOSC glossary project and FAIRsFAIR were also undertaken."

next-steps:
- "A first revision will be issued by PaNOSC at the end of May ‘20 and ExPaNDS will then extend it to the national PaN RIs after consulting with them and comparing to current data policies. The consultation questions are being finalised, with the aim of starting the consultations in May.<br>
The FAIRsFAIR policy enhancement guidelines will also be used to guide some aspects of the work extending the PaNOSC policy to national RIs."
- ""
- "Next steps will be to meet to discuss the terms and definitions and to aim to reach a consensus about which terms with which definitions to include. "
- "The opportunity for some cross over work with the FREYA project e.g. on PIDs for instruments are being discussed (very early discussions)."
- ""
- "WP2 will participate in the FAIRsFAIR synchronisation workshop at the end of April and early May."
