overview: "Like every other activity, WP3 has needed to adapt to the new enforced working practices and travel restrictions, in particular adjusting the meetings format. The most active task has been the development of the ontology, with an extensive engagement of both PaN and EOSC communities. The collaboration work with PaNOSC has continued with shared virtual meetings and collaborative tasks."

progress:
- "Based on the previously reported survey <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3673810'>DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3673810</a>, the structure and contents of D3.1 has been agreed and is now in preparation.<br>
Collaborators within the ICAT data catalogue (HZB and UKRI from ExPaNDS) have developed a plug-in for OAI-PMH protocol for OpenAire which has helped sites including PaNOSC sites to be harvested, which will give the opportunity to publish datasets in EOSC.<br>
As a result of the drive to publish open data related to CoronaVirus research by ExPaNDS facilities there has been an increased activity at facilities to enable relevant datasets to become public. This activity will ultimately underpin ExPaNDS to make data and services FAIR and available on EOSC. An example of this work is at PSI where a 10TB imaging dataset of a lung sample has been made available. This and other examples will be used as example use cases and pilot studies.<br>
Additionally, several members of WP3 were heavily involved in helping to release version 1.0 of the PaN search API that will offer a standard interface between metadata catalogues and EOSC. This contributed significantly to a PaNOSC deliverable and enables later ExPaNDS WP3 deliverables."
- "This task has been by far the most active within WP3, largely driven by the enthusiasm and drive of Silvia da Garcia Ramos from Diamond, which does deserve special recognition. There has also been extensive community engagement which includes:<br>
• Develop and release a first draft for the PaNKOS ontology update with work from HZB.<br>
• Engage with CalipsoPlus project with presentation on Way for light, which already has an extensive list of photon instruments. <br>
• Engage with EOSC. How ExPaNDS services will be deployed in EOSC? A presentation on EOSC onboarding is being organised by WP1. The contact was initially about understanding which ontology repository we should use and how the ontology would be integrated into EOSC as a service. <br>
• Engage with WP2 in particular task 2.3. Participation in the deliverable D2.2 <br>
• A significant stakeholder engagement was conducted through a survey on how to search for data in a data catalogue. Analysis has been performed and the results were recently presented in a joint WP3 ExPaNDS and PaNOSC presentation. A full report is also underway.<br>
• Coordination of ontology work with other key collaborators including PaNOSC."
