progress:
- "With the end of the first reporting period in February 2021, WP1 wrote the technical part of the periodic report for the Commission, with contributions from all WPs. A public version was also published <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4727980'>as a deliverable</a>. <br>
Following the project’s mid-term review which happened in June 2021, several recommendations were issued and followed-up by WP1. <br>
After the review, a second amendment of the grant was prepared along with WP6 to rewrite the user engagement strategy, in line with the ‘new paradigm’ brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. The new strategy and associated amendment were approved by the EC in October 2021."
- "During the review process after M18, the financial part of the first periodic report was consolidated by WP1 to assess the ability of the Consortium to allocate the needed resources in time. A resources allocation monitoring plan was put in place as an addition to the existing mechanisms. <br>
The second report on cumulative expenditure incurred by the partners was delivered in December 2021, showing a good progress in the spending rates of most partners."
- "The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5718671'>testing and validation framework</a> written in the frame of WP4 is applying EOSC Synergy’s software quality rules.<br>
The project’s KPIs were updated at mid-term and refined. They are now settled and monitored in Sharepoint. In addition, the project’s objectives were refined to include target values that are since then followed up in a <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/ExPaNDS-objectives-dashboard-per-partner'>public dashboard</a>. <br>
Following a recommendation from mid-term review, the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QabJvqd3fDPZ8W1L7sl2FBYos4Ww7krQyJZZqsgN-KM/edit'>risk analysis</a> was updated in January 2022, along with PaNOSC’s project manager."
- "The second PaN EOSC symposium was co-organised by WP6, WP1 and PaNOSC in October 2021. Recordings and reports are available in <a href='https://expands.eu/presentations/'>expands.eu</a>.<br> 
The ExPaNDS GitHub was extended with several new <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki'>wiki pages</a> and the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues'>issues</a> are now monitored there, after a progressive shift from SharePoint’s issue tracker which was not used enough."
- "In April 2021, WP1 organised a training workshop on EOSC, including presentations from B2FIND, OpenAIRE, the EOSC Synergy project as well as PaNOSC.<br>
WP1 participated in the Copenhagen workshop organised by PaNOSC in November 2021 to plan the last year of PaNOSC. <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/Mapping-ExPaNDS-and-PaNOSC-activities'>The wiki page mapping activities between the two projects</a> was updated.<br>
Since December 2021, WP1 is updating the technical architecture of the project in relation with PaNOSC and EOSC, with contributions from the technical coordinator, WP3 and WP4.
WP1 set up a working group to support partners in their onboarding procedure with EOSC. The first meeting was held in February 2022 and a mailing list was set up for this group: <a href='mailto:eosc-onboarding@expands.eu'>eosc-onboarding@expands.eu</a>.<br>
Two services from PSI were recently onboarded:<br>
- a <a href='https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/psi-public-data-repository'>public data repository</a><br>
- a <a href='https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/remote-desktop-service'>NoMachine Remote Desktop service</a>"
- "Following the presentation of ExPaNDS and PaNOSC’s outcomes to the LEAPS plenary in October 2022, LEAPS and LENS chairs were invited to the 2nd PaN EOSC symposium to respond and present the position of each of their members towards our project’s results. The survey they conducted showed a very good uptake rate of the results by almost all partners, especially on the LEAPS side."
- "After the first extended PEB organised in February 2021, a second extended PEB took place in January 2022 to prepare for the last year of the project’s execution with all partners.<br>
2 additional collaboration board meetings were organised in 2021, notably around the project’s mid-term review and second amendment."

next-steps:
- "In March 22, the second interim report covering the period M18-M30 of the project will be carried out by WP1. The progress reports issued for each WP will be used to check the consistency with the resources spent for each WP."
- "The upcoming interim report will enable WP1 to check whether the resources allocation of each partner went according to plan. In case issues are still identified, as mentioned in the first periodic report to the EC, an additional interim report will be planned at M36 to make sure final corrective actions are effective."
- "Opportunities to collaborate with the <a href='https://leaps-initiative.eu/leaps-idea/'>IDEA initiative within LEAPS</a> will be explored in the last year of the project. Several ways to better disseminate women in science were also discussed with WP6, e.g. the upcoming webinar showcasing careers in data science will be including female role models."
- "WP1 will continue maintaining the developed communication tools to make information as easy to share and find as possible, adding for example a catalogue of ExPaNDS presentations (see <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/issues/40'>issue #40</a>)."
- "WP1 will finalise the update of the architecture in spring 2022 and keep assisting partners to onboard their ExPaNDS-related services to EOSC. The status of each facility will continue being monitored in the <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/ExPaNDS-objectives-dashboard-per-partner'>objectives dashboard</a>."
- "The main focus of WP1 for the last year will be to build on LEAPS and LENS readiness to adopt our services by providing them with a synthetic one-page document for each one, explaining its detailed sustainability plan. This will be developed in collaboration with PaNOSC’s work package on sustainability."
- "The opportunity to use the technical coordination board for the implementation phase of the project will be discussed with the technical coordinator."
- "The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672926'>project’s DMP</a> will be updated to represent the final status of ExPaNDS “data” at the end of the project. Following one of our mid-term recommendations, possible IPR issues in the project will be identified and discussed."
