title: "WP1 progress report"
wp: "1"
start-date: 2019-09-01
end-date: 2020-05-31
timespan: 9

overview: "Since the kick-off meeting in Sept. ‘19, WP1 has defined the project structure with the communication plan and set up its control mechanisms with the quality assurance plan and risk analysis. It has also established the contact channels with PaNOSC and the other INFRAEOSC 5b projects and has delivered the first technical architecture in relation with EOSC in Feb. ‘20."

progress:
- "The Project Executive Board (PEB) gathering all WP leaders, technical and project coordinators is the main management structure of the project. Meetings take place every second Tuesdays since Nov ‘19. WP1 organises the agenda and records the minutes.<br>
To keep track of the WPs’ progress and alignment to their goals, progress reports are now regularly issued. The first progress reports came out in April ‘20."
- "For now WP1 only monitored qualitative indicators like recruitment status."
- "Since the proposal, the project’s KPIs were refined by WP1 and when possible, matched to PaNOSC’s. They are currently being reviewed by the WP leaders.<br>
A first risk analysis was carried out in Dec’ 19 and an update is currently in progress to closely monitor the consequences of Brexit and COVID-19.<br>
As requested by the EU, gender balance is monitored in ExPaNDS’ who’s who file."
- "The following tools for internal communication were set up by WP1:<br>
- mailing lists for each appropriate group<br>
- conference room at meet.desy.de<br>
- shared calendar for all ExPaNDS-related meetings and events (incl. PaNOSC)<br>
- a who’s who file with contributors roles and contact details<br>
WP1 is also organising with WP6 and PaNOSC a joint all-hands annual meeting of both projects to be held in Nov ‘20."
- "Since the signature of the Collaboration Agreement with the other 5b projects in Dec. ‘19, WP1 set up the involvement of ExPaNDS in the associated ‘task forces’ (TFs). It is also directly involved in the Sustainability Working Group of the EOSC Executive Board and in the ‘policies’ and ‘onboarding’ TFs.<br>
In addition, WP1 participates in the EOSC liaison platform and organises ExPaNDS feedback to relevant EOSC-related documents, like for example the EOSC assessment survey from the European Commission or the EOSC-hub core services specifications.<br>
WP1 wrote with the other 5b projects the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3831561'>position paper on EOSC</a> for ExPaNDS,
building on the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3689420'>paper published by PaNOSC</a> in Dec. ‘19.<br>
To make sure technical common work between ExPaNDS and PaNOSC is satisfactory and that communication is seamless, WP1 participates biweekly in PaNOSC’s PMC (which is the equivalent of ExPaNDS PEB) and has monthly meeting with its project manager.<br>
Finally, the alignment of ExPaNDS’ services with EOSC was at the centre of the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3697704'>technical architecture</a> elaborated by WP1 with WP3 and WP4."
- "WP1 issued recommendations to each WP in the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715279'>sustainability policy report</a> to make their achievements persist after the end of the project."
- "WP1 organised so far 2 Collaboration Board meetings and follows up on the decisions taken. The members of the Technical Coordination Board were nominated and endorsed by the CB, including a PaNOSC technical representative, all of which WP1 facilitated.<br>
The ‘EOSC liaison group’ didn’t meet so far. Its objectives are for now leveraged by ExPaNDS participation in the existing EOSC WGs and interest groups where LEAPS, GEANT and OpenAire are also involved. Our partner EGI is also a direct actor in EOSC-hub, EOSC-Enhance and the future INFRAEOSC-03 and 07 calls projects."
- "An ExPaNDS community was set up in Zenodo in Jan. ‘20 and is used to make our public deliverables findable and accessible. The use of CC licences for ExPaNDS outputs is encouraged whenever possible.<br>
Partner are well aware of the precautions when handling personal data in surveys or registration forms. The handling of personal data for project management purposes is explained to each ExPaNDS contributor in the welcome message to all@expands.eu which was checked with DESY’s Data Protection Officer. A mailing list was set up (popd@expands.eu) to record consent from project participants to appear in photos on social media."

next-steps:
- "The first interim report period will take place during M10 (June ‘20). WP1 will update the progress reports with the WP leaders to have an overall technical picture to compare with the first financial report (see T1.2)."
- "The first interim report period will allow WP1 to make a first consolidated financial report, including PMs and costs spent for the first 9 months of ExPaNDS. Its analysis will be presented to the Collaboration Board."
- "Once finalised, the active KPIs will be monitored and issued in the next progress reports. The risk analysis will be updated in Nov. ‘20."
- ""
- "WP1 will carry on making sure ExPaNDS contributors are aware of other projects achievements that we could benefit from, participating to relevant meetings and helping ExPaNDS be represented at conferences with WP6 (EGI conference, ESOF...).<br>
The alignment of ExPaNDS’ services to the EOSC architecture will continuously be monitored, following the technical developments."
- "WP1 will closely follow the outputs of the Sustainability WG, in particular the ‘Iron lady’ document to be issued by the end of 2020, and update its sustainability policy accordingly."
- "The next Collaboration Meeting is being organised in July ‘20."
- "At the beginning of 2021, the UK will not be bound by the GDPR anymore. An update of the POPD deliverable will be made accordingly, if necessary."
