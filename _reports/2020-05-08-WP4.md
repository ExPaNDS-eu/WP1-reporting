timespan: 8

overview: "Since the beginning of the project, WP4 has
primarily concentrated on recruiting and
establishing an appropriate working structure for
all members across locations. Since the start of
March we have had to adapt to the new travel and
work restrictions that we are now all only too
familiar with.<br>
Technically, WP4 has focused on the definition of
demonstration services and associated use-cases, on the general architecture of the future services with
WP3 and on the PaNOSC portal deployment challenges at ExPaNDS sites."

progress:
- "An on site kick-off meeting took place as a satellite to the ExPaNDS kick-off meeting on
11-12 Sept. ‘19, followed by an additional meeting at the 6-month mark, on the 7 th of
February, in Hamburg, to coordinate the work between the contributing RIs and with
PaNOSC. Contributors agreed on a draft architecture that could integrate into the
<a href='https://confluence.panosc.eu/display/wp4/Common+Portal+Design'>PaNOSC portal</a>.<br>
Since end of March regular WP4 meeting take place (~1 every two weeks).<br>
WP4 also contributed to the general architecture description in relation to the EOSC
<a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3697704'>deliverable</a> published in Mar. ‘20 with WP3 and WP1. For EOSC coordination follow-up
and NGIs reporting, EGI is directly involved in WP4."
- "A 1-page description to propose a demonstration service to be implemented into EOSC is
currently being elaborated by each site, with a matching data set (see T4.4)."
- "The deployment of the PaNOSC portal at ExPaNDS sites was agreed, it is beneficial for us
because it represents a step on the right direction for our users, towards integrated
remote analysis solutions. Diamond’s integration is advanced enough that it will be
demonstrated at the PaNOSC review meeting in June ‘20.<br>
For other facilities having to address challenges concerning AAI, data access and HPC
resources access, WP4 is picking ‘real world’ use cases at the national RIs and is working
to adapt them and make them work in a services model.<br>
ExPaNDS partners also agreed in Jan. ‘20 to continue populating the PaN software
catalogue.<br>
Since the start of the project, WP4 contributors regularly attend PaNOSC’s regular
meetings which take place every two weeks."
- "This task is much linked to T4.2 and the data sets are being identified along with the
matching services. The best way to upload and store them is currently being investigated."
