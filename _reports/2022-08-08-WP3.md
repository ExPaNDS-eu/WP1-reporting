progress:
- "The same data landscaping survey was circulated on Aug 22 and analysed to drive helping facilities and get a status update"
- "Publishing of PaNET is still under development. There is now a core team of some five individuals and progress can be tracked in issues 13, 21, and 48."
- "A <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/pan-ontologies-api'>site-independent implementation</a> of PaNET retrieval is implemented and can be easily configured for use by other facilities. The documentation is available in the same repository and integration with SciCat and the search-api is available."
- "The survey has been circulated and the results helped organise a suitable workshop, mainly discussing how to adopt one of the main data catalogues. Details can be found <a href='https://zenodo.org/record/6414117#.Yv98PdJByV4'>here</a>. ."
- "An Umbrella workshop by experts in the field took place on 3/05/22. Details can be found <a href='https://indico.psi.ch/event/12701/'>here</a>. This provided the audience with the tools to get started with UmbrellaID and an interactive session allowed the hosts to singularly help facilities set up UmbrellaID."
- "All training material collected during the course of ExPaNDS for WP3 has been collected in the deliverable D3.4 and is available <a href='https://zenodo.org/record/6390324#.Yv99v9JByV4 '>here</a> and on the PaN training platform.
WP5 helped set up training workflows in the PaN training portal and in particular the one which covers the <a href='https://pan-training.eu/workflows/metadata-catalogue-services.'>metadata catalogue services</a>."

next-steps:
- "By the end of the project, WP3 will circulate the survey again and collect the latest results."
- "A core team will work on the publication."
- "Coordinate with the other facilities about the use and collect an update on the status of the integration with ICAT."
