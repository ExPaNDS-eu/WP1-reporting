overview: "Since May 2020, WP2 published two major documents on PaN data policies and metadata, delivering a first draft FAIR data framework for ExPaNDS facilities.<br>
Consultations on the FAIR-readiness of individual data policies have started and will continue over the next year.<br>
The first training workshops on FAIR for instrument scientists and other facility staff took place at the beginning of October 2020, gathering ~100 individuals."

progress:
- "After the publication of the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3862701'>PaNOSC model data policy</a> in May ‘20, WP2 started to consult our national facilities on it. The first consultations revealed the need to change the initial strategy for the D2.1 deliverable. More time and a step back was necessary to have in-depth dialog with facilities management and be able to advise in their possible data policy update. <br>
A landscape of the national data policies was included in the deliverable as well as 30 key elements of a data policy, to be used for further consultations. FAIRsFAIR's <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3686901'>policy enhancement recommendations</a> were also applied in our framework. This strategy and subsequent deliverable were presented during the INFRA-EOSC-5 task force on FAIR."
- "Following introductory work on DMPs with PaNOSC, the task was officially kicked-off for WP2 in early Jan. ‘21. In Dec. ‘20, discussions with DANS (EOSC-hub) for a possible workshop on DMPs to be organised during the first quarter of 2021 took place. The topic will be followed-up in the next few weeks."
- "Building on the glossary works, WP2 provided input to the <a href='https://eosc-portal.eu/glossary'>EOSC glossary</a> in Oct. ‘20 which was included in the next version. <br>The main effort for this task was the common work with the partners and WP3 to agree on what metadata is to be recorded at each step of an experiment life cycle, in an attempt to update the PaNdata ODI. This work is detailed in the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4312825'>draft recommendations for FAIR Photon and Neutron Data Management</a> published in Dec. ‘20."
- "In June ‘20, WP2 participated in the discussions on the EOSC PID policy during a workshop organised by the EOSC WG on FAIR. <br>In the project <i>per se</i>, the task was kicked-off in Jan. ‘21. It will develop around two working groups, the first being composed of the usual suspects to work on the deliverables and the second group including more individuals, notably from WP3, to be used as a forum on PID practices at our different facilities. A first meeting of the latter took place at the end of Jan. ‘21."
- "Following the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4486280'>INFRA-EOSC-5 TF on FAIR dedicated to automatic FAIR assessment of repositories</a>, WP2 is evaluating the opportunity to use F-UJI to assess the FAIRness of our facilities repositories."
- "WP2 organised a series of two workshops on FAIR in Oct. ‘20, with ~100 attendees for each session (<a href='https://expands.eu/presentations/'>see recordings</a>). The workshops offered participants an overview of the benefits of FAIR, what is FAIR vs open, the use of DOIs and what metadata is to be expected at each step of the life cycle of a typical experiment. It was targeted to instrument scientists, computing staff and senior management. Speakers from FAIRsFAIR and PaNOSC also contributed. <br>WP2 also participated in FAIRsFAIR synchronisation workshops in June 2020 and applied for a session at the next RDA meeting in April under the <a href='https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-needs-photon-and-neutron-science-community.html'>PaNSIG group banner</a>.<br>
WP2 also met with WP5 to better define the strategy for the training material to be produced, including also FAIRsFAIR contributors."

next-steps:
- "Carry on with the consultations with the facility staff in charge of the data policies, using the 30 key elements of a policy."
- "During the kick-off, it was decided to have joint monthly meetings with PaNOSC to progress on this task. PaNOSC will focus on the DMP template aspects (with feed in from ExPaNDS partners) and ExPaNDS will focus on use cases to demonstrate the implementation of the DMP template and how this adds value for both researchers and the facility."
- "Next steps will be to trigger feedback from facilities staff on the published metadata framework, with the objective to update the deliverable. A presentation of the metadata framework to the INFRA-EOSC-5 task force on FAIR is also scheduled in March ‘21."
- "The first PID workshop will be summarised in a report. The objective of this group will be to establish guidelines for facilities which do not have a PID infrastructure yet."
- ""
- "Discussions are ongoing with WP6 for a symposium targeted specifically at librarians to cover all FAIR data management aspects in their area of expertise."
