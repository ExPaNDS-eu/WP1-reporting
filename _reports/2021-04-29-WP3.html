overview: "Since the roadmap to help facilities develop their strategies towards a FAIR data catalogue was published, we now see progress in its implementation. ExPaNDS' first data catalogue is harvested by B2FIND since March 2021 (PSI) and another facility migrated towards the use of the SciCat community catalogue (Soleil). Significant progress was made on the PaN techniques ontology which is already available as a draft in BioPortal, a NCBO service which will be onboarded to EOSC thanks to our action."

progress:
- "The roadmap and gap analysis for implementing a FAIR data catalogue and ensuring that data is available for data reprocessing in WP4 was published in early November 2020. "
- "The structure of the experimental technique ontology was agreed across all ExPaNDS and PaNOSC partners. A first version of the techniques ontology will be published at the end of May 2021, in OWL format. It applies the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02325'>Ten Simple Rules for making a vocabulary FAIR</a>. Since its delivery will be staged and challenged by implementations and feedback from the community, a reproducible workflow for its deployment was set up.<br/>The second aspect of the ontologies work is related to the NeXus format. A script to convert the base and upper definition classes defined in the NeXus Definition Language format to an OWL format was developed. Once approved by the NIAC, it will be a sustainable tool that benefits the NeXus ontology, providing PIDs hence making it FAIRer.<br/>The existing ontology repository for life science <a href='https://bioportal.bioontology.org/'>BioPortal</a> will be used to publish our ontologies. Steps were taken by EGI and Diamond to have BioPortal onboard into EOSC."
- "The implementation of the ontologies into SciCat and ICAT metadata catalogues is developing at several facilities (PSI, Diamond and ISIS), covering discussion with instrument scientists, historical modification of data and definition of ingestion method for new data. <br/>There has also been extensive collaboration with PaNOSC for the PaN search API deliverable."
- ""
- "In parallel to the development of the search aggregator service (PaN search API), the deployment of an OAI-PMH in our data catalogues to make metadata accessible to EOSC harvestors like B2FIND and OpenAire is progressing at several facilities. A <a href='https://github.com/ExPaNDS-eu/ExPaNDS/wiki/Delivering-data-services-to-EOSC'>workshop</a> was organised at the beginning of April 2021 to share experience and existing plug-ins for SciCat and ICAT."

next-steps:
- "The landscape analysis and associated deliverable have developed into a KPI for the project so will continue to be monitored as part of the ongoing progress monitoring of the project. It is also envisaged that additional workshops will be required to help disseminate activities between RIâ€™s especially where resources are only now starting."
- "After the D3.2 delivery at the end of May 2021, WP3 will continue to work with other domain leaders especially the NeXus and PaNOSC communities. One additional aspect that will continue is the engagement with end user communities (with WP6) to ensure the overall ontology adequately describes their work and provides a useful FAIR tool."
- "Although the majority of the work for Task 3.3 has been undertaken by ExPaNDS and PaNOSC developers working in the existing collaboration frameworks of SciCat and ICAT, it is envisaged that the workpackage will need to ensure lessons learnt and successes will be shared between the implementers."
