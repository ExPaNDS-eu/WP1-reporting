progress:
- ""
- "The combination of the PaN e-learning platform developed by PaNOSC with the PaN training catalogue developed by WP5 from TeSS was chosen for our PaN training service which is now regrouped under the same landing page: <a href='https://pan-training.eu'>pan-training.eu</a>. The evaluation of available platforms and reasons for this choice are presented in <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171766'>the associated deliverable</a>. A <a href='https://pan-training.hzdr.de/about'>video</a> was also released to guide users in the use of the platform.<br>
The training service is since then continuously enhanced with features like the automatic harvesting of LEAPS and Laserlab-Europe events and PaN e-learning courses. The PaNET ontology from WP3 was integrated to help the user pre-fill the “scientific topics” metadata field.<br>
The workflow feature offered by pan-training.eu was used to present the TELBE data analysis workflow at the <a href='https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636331'>2nd PaN EOSC symposium</a>."
- "Following a recommendation we received at the mid-term review, the initial outlines for training material creation were refined and gathered in a training plan. The training plan was shared with WP leaders.<br>The training catalogue now contains more than 110 materials, among which 22 are provided by ExPaNDS itself. There are also 5 workflows."
- "All ExPaNDS-related KPIs for training can now be monitored, including the number of unique visitors to the training catalogue (<a href='https://github.com/pan-training/training-catalogue/issues/20'>see associated issue</a>)."

next-steps:
- "Three additional series of workshops will be organised during the final year of the project. The next topics will be focused on WP3 and WP4 developments and will ensure a maximum take-up of the project's results."
- "Next step will be to implement UmbrellaID as a log-in option for content providers. Work on standardised metadata for training material will continue to be developed."
- "Additional material will be produced and published in the last year of the project, notably:<br>- guidance notes for WP2 outputs (as it was done for the data policy framework),<br>- workflows for the 5 data analysis prototypes that will be made available in EOSC,<br>- supporting material for the upcoming workshops."
- "The KPIs and the lessons learned from the post-workshops surveys will be described in the final deliverable for WP5 (D5.6)."
