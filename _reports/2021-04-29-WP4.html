timespan: 12

overview: "Making datasets available to all facilities, portal demo at annual meeting, technical workshop on the portal architecture test experience, with PaNOSC and CALIPSOplus"

progress:
- "Discussions within T4.1 contributed towards the D4.1 organisational framework document defining the organisational framework for during and after the project and guidelines for integrating existing analysis services into EOSC through the PaN portal.<br>
This task is now completed."
- "The selection of data analysis services has proceeded in parallel with the selection of appropriate reference datasets (T4.4). We have identified the techniques on which we will focus, and identified the reference data sets."
- "An instance of the PaN portal is being successfully deployed on DESY and in construction on PSI infrastructure
Very close work with PaNOSC on the portal deployment
Portal architecture test experience (https://indico.cells.es/event/249/contributions/) and survey"
- "Data sets have been selected, meanwhile the best way in which to store these datasets for linking to analysis services is currently being determined (solved?).
The selection of reference data sets has proceeded in parallel with the selection of data analysis services (T4.2). The skeleton of 13 reference data sets have been identified and documented in a shared document with contributions from all participating facilities"
- "Commenced discussion on the testing and validation requirements, test instance planned at DESY?
MaxIV: JupyterHub test-instance as a starter and demo
Testing and validating the installation of services in reference to application cases (100 jupyter notebooks linked to the data in storage), itâ€™s operational only if the instance validates against reference. High-level testing seems easier, so focusing on user level
Need a place to share doc and code. Do this for the reference datasets and associated workflows. Application example to be abstracted.
Other use cases need to be added after, not only Jupyter."
- "Commenced discussion on the technical implementation details at each facility, included in upcoming D4.1 and try to put up a virtual machine with data analysis on a web browser. Work independently from PaNOSC portal to make steps and decouple."
- "Commenced discussion on the interoperability requirements for EOSC, included in upcoming D4.1"

next-steps:
- ""
- "The selected candidate data analysis services are described in the D4.2 deliverable, which will be finalised by the end of February."
- "Link to data <br>
Deployment in other facilities"
- "Finalise document as deliverable D4.2 and publish the datasets"
- "Abstract and add other use cases, not only Jupyter to have it applicable for every facility even the ones with no "
- ""
